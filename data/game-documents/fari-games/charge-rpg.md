# Introductions | Power Your Story Telling

![Charge](https://gyazo.com/5b8633befdb6fe3f894bdabaedac4001.png)

First, thank you.

The fact that you are reading this and are interested in playing this game means a lot to us, so thanks a million.

You're amazing, i's as simple as that.

Now, one of the first things you probably want to know is: **who is this game for?**

> This game is for people who want to play a generic, narrative table-top RPG adventure about a group of characters struggling to achieve their goals, but pushing themselves to get there.

Some mechanics were inspired or adapted from the Fate or Forged in the Dark systems, while others were created to make for more interactive sessions that naturally urge players to interact with the world.

Now let's get to it! ⚡

## Contributing

One of the core part of what makes this game unique is that it **belongs to the community**.

The game is free, released under an open game license, and welcomes contributions.

Some systems encourage game designers to develop their own games using their rules. Charge, on the other hand, encourages game designers to help make it grow.

What we mean by that is that you can:

- Suggest core rules updates
- Provide new Extras
- Help rise the quality and reachability of the game by proofreading or translating it
- etc.

If you contribute to this project in any way, your name will be properly credited on the first page of the game. If you designed a specific extra for the game, your name will also be credited there.

While Charge accepts donations, those donations will be re-invested in the game directly by commissioning the creation of official art, paying for the editing, etc.

If you want to contribute, join [Fari's Discord Server](https://fari.app/discord) or post a new topic on [Charge's Itch.io](https://itch.io/category/1498399/new-topic) page.

We can't wait to work with you all. Let's build something incredible, together.

## Work in Progress

This game is a work-in-progress. A couple of things are still missing:

- Section: Extras: more extras from us and the community
- Section: Playing the game with GM and Players best practices
- More examples

# Goals | Power Your Story Telling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/4e66d10b4b1784cc27093097134aaa35.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-sun-sea-dragon-flying-4033001/)

There are thousands of great table-top role-playing games out there. Some are generic, like Charge, and others are made with a very specific setting in mind. In the latter, mechanics are often created to reinforce the setting.

Charge is generic, which means you get to pick the world and setting you want to play in. You could play in Sci-Fi setting where new planets are still being discovered and terraformed every year, or on Earth during the British Industrial Revolution. You get to choose.

Because settings can differ greatly, Charge's game mechanics were made with very specific goals in mind to help you create the story you want to tell.

## The Idea Behind Charge

Here a some things that makes Charge special compare to other games you might have played before.

**It's easy to create characters for any settings.**

> Characters are easy to define, and still unique in their own way. Charge gives you a good framework to create characters for settings you want.
>
> Charge does this by making characters shine using `character details` to define who they are and how they're linked to the world. They have `actions` to highlight what they are good at, and `talents` to make them evolve in interesting ways.

**It offers easy to tune dials and extras to have "grimmer" up to "bigger than life" adventures.**

> From a post-apocalyptic survival adventure where each bullet counts, to a grand space opera where the heroes always prevail, the mechanics are easily tunable to reflect the kind of story you want to tell.
>
> Either adjust the main difficulty setting of the game, or use one of the many `extras` provided to play the way you want to.

**It is both a utility belt, and a toolbox.**

> Charge is a toolbox, because it has a set of mechanics to resolve narrative problems in multiple different ways. It is also a utility belt, since it gives you a default way to play that's easy to pick-up and use.
>
> Play it as is, or hack it as your want.

You will like this game if:

- you like narrative-focused systems
- you like that you can play in any setting
- you generally think that failure is more interesting than success
- you like when your character starts competent and gradually becomes more flexible
- you like playing Fate or Forged in the Dark games

Charge also brings new interesting ideas to the table, like a new flexible progression framework and new mechanics to make players want to interact with the world instead of saying still on the back-seat waiting for the best moment to act.

We hope you have fun with this, because we sure had fun writing it and playing it.

Now, let us go over what you need to play Charge!

# What You Need To Play | Power Your Story Telling

To play Charge, you need:

- Copies of the [Charge RPG Character Sheet](/documents/charge-rpg/character-sheet.pdf)
- A pile of index cards
- A set of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- A bunch of awesome people to play with. Usually 2 to 5 people should do the trick. More than that could prove quite an endeavour.

And that's it.

# The Game | Power Your Story Telling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cbb1bac26449de5d6762c699efe5585.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/spaceship-ufo-rock-mountains-5848274/)

Charge is a generic table-top role-playing game. That means that you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional character you create. Those characters face obstacles and challenges, and you get to decide how they react. The world then changes based on what the characters do.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or *NPC*s.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or *PC*s.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

This isn't a "GM versus Players" or "GM is god" kind of deal. If playing this game was like making a movie, the **GM would be the director** and all the **players would be writers**.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful and captivating.

## Game Structure

Everything inside Charge is collaborative.

You choose a setting together, you create your characters together, and you make that world evolve together.

Each session is made of `scenes`, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what they do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of certain dice rolls.

Each time you and your friends meet to play Charge is a `session` which can last between 1 and 4 hours, or even more. The amount of time each session takes depends on a lot of factors.

Each group can play very differently. Some might take their time while others might rush into things head-on, but it also depends on everyone's availability.

During sessions, tension rises during scenes, and the players encounter narrative unknowns. To decide what happens during those moments, the group rolls dice because they want to be on the edge of their seats. They want to be surprised by where the story takes them next.

Before we look at how to create the players' characters, we need to talk about making a safe environment for everyone at the table.

# Safety at the Table | Power Your Story Telling

## Safety Tools

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

## RPG Etiquette

Remember to be empathetic of people's schedules and responsibilities. Some people have kids, pets, jobs, and other things that make scheduling sessions very hard. Show up on time and take the amount of gameplay time that you can get.

Then, patiently wait until the next session. And while you are waiting, remember and praise the awesome moments that happened in the last session.

# Creating your Character | Character Creation

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/6c402c4fb66bc6ac29d20b7bee048d9a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/landscape-fantastic-surreal-mood-6543972/)

As a player, you create a `character`.

Your character is defined by certain traits, and tied to certain elements of the world they live in. They will affect the world around them with their `actions`. Through their actions might come `consequences` which might inflict `stress` or worsen their `condition`.

The `details` of your characters are a good way to make your characters unique in the fiction, but Charge uses `talents` to make each character shine in their own special way.

You can find each of those terms in the character sheet, but let's go over what all of them mean and how we use them during a session.

## Details

When creating your character, you figure out who they are, what they look like, and how they are tied to the world. We call this information the character's details.

![](https://gyazo.com/e4ac2539a73b8650b7aee2ca20661371.png)

### Concept

The `concept` of your character is like the elevator-pitch version of who they are.

On your character sheet, write a small sentence that quickly sums them up.

A good concept could include things like:

- their profession or role within the group
- where they come from
- a personality trait
- a unique talent they possess
- etc.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Appearance

Next is your character's `appearance`.

Use this section to describe what your character looks like. You can talk about their shape, size, what they wear, etc.

This will help everyone at the table when they need to picture your character as they are interacting with them.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Ties

Since your character is one of the story's protagonists, they need to be linked to the different forces in the world. They weren't born yesterday (or were they?), so they have probably made friends or foes with different people or organizations.

To establish those links, we define `ties`.

A tie links your character to another player's character, an organization, etc.

When you write down a tie for your character, try to answer **who is my character linked to** and also **how they are linked to them**.

This will also help establish a bit of a general backstory for your character, without you having to write down 10 pages of notes that might end up unused.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

> #### Choosing Details in Play
>
> You don't need to entirely flesh out your character before you start playing.
>
> Simply choosing your `concept` is more than enough to get going.
>
> After the first session or two, you will have a better idea of who your character is, so finding those details later is totally fine.
>
> But if you want some help in fleshing out your characters, you can always use the free [Fari Story Builder](https://fari.app/story-builder) to get the inspiration flowing again!
> ![](https://gyazo.com/5b5e8bf5924e020ea2bc0926103a20f2.gif)

## Actions

If a player character wants to do something challenging or that could potentially fail, they make an **action roll.**

Failure is possible if there is some sort of obstacle to overcome, like something that's in your way or somebody looking to stop you.

That being said, not every interaction with the world requires a roll. If the character does something we'd expect them to simply accomplish, then you don't roll anything. They simply do it.

In Charge, there are **12 actions** characters can do.

When creating a character, you need to **distribute 7 action dots** among those 12 actions. At the start of a campaign, a single Action cannot have more than 2 action dots.

Those dots represent how good your character is at doing things. As the game progresses, you will gain additional dots that make your character more flexible. See [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](mechanics#progression).

The 12 actions are grouped into 3 categories called `Attributes`. There is `Physique`, `Insight` and `Resolve`.

Each attribute is important in its own way, since they let you resist different types of danger when things go sour. More on that in [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Resistance Roll**](mechanics#resistance-roll).

For now let's look at the 12 different types of actions.

### The 12 Actions

![12 Actions](https://gyazo.com/a0cc5668a0e3b486af1b166099b9da51.png)

#### Physique

When you `Brawl`, you clash with something that is in your way.

> You might hack and slash. You might wrestle with a wild animal. You might blast a door open. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but `Finessing` might be better).

When you `Finesse`, you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.

> You might steal something from someone's pocket. You might hack a security system. You might helm the controls of a ship. You could try to pick a lock (but `Tinkering` might be better).

When you `Move`, you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.

> You might climb, swim, run, or jump. You might outpace the guards. You might jump above a spiked pit. You could try to lose someone on your tail (but `Sneak` might be better).

When you `Sneak`, you traverse skillfully and quietly.

> You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You could try to back-stab a solder in the middle of a battle (but `Brawl` might be better).

#### Insight

When you `Shoot`, you carefully track and shoot a target.

> You might snipe an enemy long-distance. You might throw a fireball to light the battlefield on fire. You might aim the ship's laser guns. You could try skillfully throw a dart in a bar game (but `Finessing` might be better).

When you `Tinker`, you understand, create, or repair complex mechanisms or organisms.

> You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might mend a broken bone. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but `Finessing` might be better).

When you `Study`, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

> You might gather information from documents, newspapers, and books. You might closely analyze a person to detect lies or true feelings. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation (but `Noticing` might be better).

When you `Notice`, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

> You might pick up important details in the moment. You might anticipate danger before it happens. You could try to figure out what is making someone sick (but `Studying` might be better).

#### Resolve

When you `Bond`, you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.

> You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm, style, or empathy. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but `Sway` might be better).

When you `Command`, you compel swift obedience with skills and respect.

> You might intimidate or threaten to get what you want. You might ask a small militia to get their things together. You might order your undead minions to sacrifice themselves for you. You could also ask your familiar to look for something in a room (but `Bonding` might be better).

When you `Focus`, you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.

> You might meditate to enter the spirit world. You might concentrate to win a game of chess. You might enter a trance to finish up an important ritual. You could try to pay closer attention to your surroundings beyond what is visible (but `Noticing` might be better).

When you `Sway`, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

> You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but `Bonding` or `Commanding` might be better).

### **Which Action to Pick for a Roll**

Some actions may overlap with others. This is by design. As your campaign progress, you group will also establish which action is the most effective in given situations.

Make this game your own.

As a player, you get to choose which action you roll by simply saying what your character does. Choosing one approach versus another might influence the position or effect of your action. The GM should tell you those details before you roll.

## Momentum

A character's `momentum` is a track that represents the _momentum_ of your character. The more you interact with the world, and the people that live in it, the more your character gains `charges of momentum`.

You then consume those charges to boost your action rolls or assist your teammates.

![](https://gyazo.com/e0aac9468c6a2a2932e59da933c64e21.png)

When you are out of momentum, things can go bad pretty quickly since you also it them to resist incoming consequences or harm.

## Stress & Condition

When your character faces dangerous challenges and fails their action roll, something bad happens.

Maybe the situation is more complicated or even perilous. The alternative to this is that you get hurt. The GM is the one who decides if the `consequence` of the roll is harm or something else.

Each character has a `condition` that is tied to a `condition clock` which includes 4 segments.

![Condition](https://gyazo.com/468a4a981adfbc795ef328b3b95e798a.png)

When you get hurt, you take a certain amount of `stress`, and each stress ticks a segment on your `condition clock`. Depending on the number of segments ticked, you represent how your character is doing by updating your `condition` which is represented by a little text field below the clock.

When a character has a condition, their narrative liberties are restricted by said condition.

For example, it's almost impossible to climb on the roof of a house with a _Twisted Anlke_. So even if you have only **2 segments** ticked on your condition clock, your condition in and of itself still imposes narrative restrictions on what your character can do.

Here are a couple examples of conditions:

- When your condition clock has **1 or 2 segments** filled, you might be: exhausted, humiliated, tired, sore, winded, sick, etc.
- When your condition clock has **3 segments** filled, you might have a gunshot wound, a slash from a blade, a first degree burn, or be completely drunk.
- When your condition clock reaches **4 filled segments**, you clear the condition clock, and are taken out for the scene. You might have gotten a second degree burn, or a fractured leg, or your brain can't comprehend what is happening anymore.

## Talents

`Talents` are a way to make the characters progress over the course of a campaign.

Over time, characters gain new `talent dots` which make their Talent Line advance.

![](https://gyazo.com/6cab207e891b02249a7f96c66694010a.png)

Every dot in the talent line gives you either a new `action dot`, or a `situational bonus`.

A situational bonus represents a boost in `effect`, `position` or `dice pool`, and triggers only in a certain situation.

You don't need to worry about talents right now, especially if you just started your campaign.

When your campaign reaches a significant turning point, you can read [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](progression#milestones) to know how to make the characters feel more powerful.

## Projects and Complications

The `Projects and Complications` section of the character sheet is something the GM and players use to track long-term projects or ever-evolving dangers that span multiple sessions.

![](https://gyazo.com/cc0d601c9fc82fbfe8a433ac3fdc303d.png)

You don't need to know how to use this right away, so for more on this, checkout [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Projects and Complications**](mechanics#projects-and-complications).

## Character Recap

That covers the basic of how to create a character for Charge.

Now we will go over all the mechanics used in the game that exist to resolve unknown elements in the narrative.

# Fiction First | Mechanics

[![Image by Yuri_B from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/d6e7b317330d9dd554970cc75543ea7e.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/painting-knight-night-oil-paints-3995999/)

**Charge is a "fiction first" game.**

This means that the GM and the players tell a story, and afterwards look at the rules to see if something needs to be resolved using the game's mechanics.

You can see the mechanics in Charge as tools in a box to use as needed. They resolve situations where you don't know the direct answers to a question.

**_Will this character find what they are looking for? Can that character convince this merchant to talk? How will this faction react to this big event? etc._**

Sometimes, those situations are resolved with a mechanic that relies on the PCs' proficiencies, while other times they might be resolved with mechanics that straight-up rely on luck!

We do this to create a "wow" feeling in unknown situations. While the story is created by everyone at the table, the mechanics act as a guide that drives the narrative forward with unexpected outcomes.

Those mechanics mostly rely on figuring out what the risks are, and what is happening. Then a set of six-sided dice is rolled, results are interpreted, and the story continues.

# Rolling Dice | Mechanics

Charge uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it's a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it's a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that's a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it's a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You probably don't achieve your goal, and you suffer complications, too.

The number of dice a player rolls depends on the `action` they are trying to accomplish. In Charge, there are 12 possible actions grouped in 3 distinct attributes.

Those actions are linked to a dice pool called the `action rating`, represented by empty dots on the character sheet.

If an action has 1 darkened dot beside it, you roll `1d6`. This gives you about a 50% chance of succeeding at your action.

If an action has 2 darkened dots, you roll `2d6`... and so on.

### Active Opposition

Since NPCs don't roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**.

The action roll tells us the results and the consequences of an action at the same time.

On a `6`, the PC wins and gets what they wanted. On a `4 or 5`, both the PC and the NPC have an effect on the result. On a `1-3`, the NPC wins and results in a consequence for the PC.

### No Action Dots

If an action doesn't have any action dots darkened, then you roll `2d6` and **pick the worst**. This gives you around a 25% chance of success, so the odds aren't great.

That being said, you can always `push yourself`, `add tension` to the scene, get an `assist`, or use an `asset` to add more dice to your pool. More on that later.

For now, let's take a look at the different tools you can use to resolve the different situations that arise in your story.

# Action Roll | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/a2bbeb6748035e90162096c3e0a9680a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-landscape-architecture-3898554/)

**_I have a bad feeling about this..._**

You want to accomplish a goal, but something or someone is in your way.

A person might be keeping information private that you desperately need, a locked door might block you from moving forward to save your friend, or a group of thugs intercepts you in an alley and wants revenge for something you've done to them in the past.

That's a challenge that needs to be overcome.

The first step in knowing whether you overcome that challenge is to know what your character is doing.

## Action

When you make an action roll, you need to know which of the **12 Actions** your character is going for. Are they `Bonding` with a local merchant, or `Swaying` them into thinking that their prices are too high?

Use the action rating (darkened dots beside the action) as your base dice pool.

> #### Choosing an Action
>
> The action you choose has an impact on the `effect` and the `position` of the roll.
>
> We will talk about those in a second, but just know that if you choose a certain action and aren't satisfied when the GM tells you what the effect or situation is, you can go back and pick another action.

## Position

If an obstacle is in your way, you are in a `controlled`, `risky`, or `desperate` position. The GM is responsible for telling you this information.

In most common scenarios, if you roll to overcome something, you are probably in a `risky` position.

Multiple things can affect your current position. You may be vastly outnumbered, or perhaps you are just out of time. The narrative context will help you and the GM decide your current position.

If the merchant you are trying to convince is in a bad mood, using `Sway` might be a pretty `desperate` move. Perhaps `Bond` could put you in a more `controlled` situation.

> #### What Position to Pick
>
> If you aren't sure of your current situation, talk with the rest of the table. A quick discussion is usually enough to clear things up.

Your position helps you determine what failure might look like. Once you know your position, the GM will tell you what it might look like to succeed on your roll.

## Effect

Your position isn't the only thing helping you dictate the end result of a roll. Even in a desperate position, succeeding on a roll might still have a great effect on the narrative.

In Charge, there are 3 possible effect ratings: `great`, `standard`, and `limited`. In most common scenarios, if you are rolling to overcome something, you are probably looking at generating a `standard` effect. The GM is responsible for telling you this information.

If a heavy door is blocking your way, you could use `Finesse` to pick the lock. This might generate a `standard effect`, since it takes some time to do, but it's a more `controlled position`. You could also try to use `Tinker` and wreck the door open with an explosive. This will be of `great effect`, but might be a `desperate move`, since it could create a lot of unwanted attention.

The Effect Rating is there to help you determine what success might look like.

#### The Fourth Effect Rating

We said there were only 3 effect ratings, and that was actually a little bit of a lie. There's a fourth one called: `no-effect`.

The GM can use this when a task is so difficult that whatever the PC attempts, the best they will end up getting is "nothing".

Obviously, doing nothing is boring. That's why you can boost that `no-effect` to a `limited effect` if you Push Yourself using charges of momentum. More on that in [Even the Odds](#even-the-odds)

#### The Impact of Effect & Position

The effect and position help us understand what happens in the narrative, but they also have a mechanical impact on the game.

To know what impact they have, numerical ratings are attached to them.

| Position     | Effect     | Rating |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| `Desperate`  | `Great`    | 3      |
| `Risky`      | `Standard` | 2      |
| `Controlled` | `Limited`  | 1      |

When a roll creates a consequence, you use the `position rating` to see how many segments you tick on danger clocks, or how much stress a character gets when they are harmed, etc.

When a roll is a success, you use the `effect rating` to see how many segments you tick on progress clocks, how much information the character gets out of an investigation, etc.

More on clocks in [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Clocks**](mechanics#clocks)

### Even the Odds

Your characters aren't proficient in everything, but they have aces up their sleeves to even the odds stacked against them.

First off, they aren't alone.

#### Ask For Help

When you `ask for help`, a willing player can consume `-1 momentum` of momentum, in exchange for you to get `+1d6` added to your dice pool. In doing so, the helper exposes themselves to the same danger as your character for helping you.

You can also even the odds by using **only one** of the following methods.

#### Push Yourself

When you `push yourself`, you consume `-2 momentum` **per push** to gain one of the following bonuses.

- Add `+1d6` to your dice pool.
- Gain `+1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action when you are incapacitated.

> _Note: you `push yourself` in a action roll, that roll won't generate `momentum`_

#### Add Tension

When you `add tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension would look like here?"_. The GM then offers a complication, like ticking segments on a danger clock, inflicting stress on your character, or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the deal, add `+1d6` to your dice pool.

#### Use an Asset

Assets are an optional rule available in [Extras&nbsp;»&nbsp;Asset Extra](asset-extra), but they are still considered an option for you to even the odds if you are using that Extra.

## Recap

So now, let's go over all of this again to recap what happens when you make an action roll.

> #### Action Roll
>
> 1. Pick an Action and find out how many dice you need to roll (the `action rating`)
> 1. Determine the `position` (`1 controlled` ► `2 risky` ► `3 desperate`)
> 1. Determine the `effect rating` (`3 great` ► `2 standard` ► `1 limited`)
> 1. Add `+1d6` if: you `push yourself` (-2 momentum) -or- if you `add tension` to the scene.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume -1 momentum)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
> ---
>
> - On a `66 critical success`, you greatly overcome the obstacle
> - On a `6 full success`, you overcome the obstacle.
> - On a `4-5 partial success`, you overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.
> - On a `1-3 bad outcome`, you fail at overcoming the obstacle, and there's a `consequence`.

_Xavier's character wants to take out a guard without him noticing anything. He decides to use **Sneak**. The GM looks at the situation and assesses that it's a **risky position** since the guard might not be alone, but the outcome would be of **great effect** because the guard isn't on high alert. Xavier doesn't want to leave everything up to chance, and decides to even the odds. He declares that his character will **push themselves** to get an additional `+1d6` by diving in the water to get closer before taking the guard out. Xavier rolls his dice pool and... gets a `5`, partial success! The GM then says that Xavier's character takes out the guard, but ticks 2 segments on an "Alert Clock" because of the noise Xavier's character made pulling the guard in the water._

# Consequences| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b40cf4934bebc8628bd3696c4e3b92c.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-castle-light-heaven-4382262/)

**_Sometimes things work out. Other times..._**

If you make an action roll and you get a `partial success ( 4-5)` or a `bad outcome (1-3)`, you suffer a single `consequence`.

Consequences are a tool the GM can use to spice up the story. The GM uses the fiction, style, and tone established by the group to determine the type of consequence.

## Consequence Rating

When a consequence is inflicted on a player, the `position` of the action roll tells us how bad that consequence is.

So a consequence that comes from a `desperate` action roll is _usually_ worse than a consequence from a `controlled` one.

We call this the `consequence rating`. Some types of consequences use this rating directly to tie the consequence with the game mechanics.

| Position     | Consequence Rating |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `Desperate`  | 3                  |
| `Risky`      | 2                  |
| `Controlled` | 1                  |

## Types of Consequences

Here are a couple of types of consequences that can be used in case of a bad roll:

### Reduced Effect

This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC's action isn't as effective as they'd anticipated.

> **Reduce the effect rating of the PC's action by one level.**
>
> ---
>
> _You hit them, but it's only a flesh wound. The security cameras are turned off, but the technicians are aware, and are looking to fix them as soon as possible._

### Complications

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat.

> **Tick one segment per `consequence rating` on a new or existing `danger clock`.**
>
> ---
>
> _They heard you, and they are coming. You took too long, and you are almost out of air._

#### Negating Success

**Don't inflict a complication that negates a successful roll**.

If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a `4-5`, don't say that the enemy escapes. The player's roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position, and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.

### Lost Opportunity

This represents shifting circumstance. What you tried didn't work, and now there's a new situation that prevents you from trying again. You need to find another approach.

> **Your latest attempt didn't work. If you want to try again, you need to use a different `action`.**
>
> ---
>
> _You were tailing on someone, but they saw you and disappeared. You were fighting a robot, but they adapted, and are now able to anticipate your every move._

### Worse Position

This consequence represents losing control of the situation. The action carries you into a more dangerous \*_position_.

Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven't failed, but you haven't succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position.

This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from **controlled**, to **risky**, to **desperate** as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper into trouble.

> **Reduce the `position rating` by one level for future rolls related to that action.**
>
> ---
>
> _You missed your shot, now they know where you are. They initially trusted you, but now they have some doubts and will be watching you more closely._

### Worse Condition

This consequence represent injuries or trauma inflicted on a character.

When your condition worsens, you take a certain amount of `stress` on your `condition clock`. You also need to update your `condition ` to represent the new state your character is in.

Your new condition will affect the narrative permissions of your character, and how they can interact with the world.

When your condition clocked is filled, you can clear all the segments, and your character is taken out for the scene.

> **Take `1 Stress` per `consequence rating` on your character's `condition`**
>
> ---
>
> _You laid down suppression fire, but got shot in the process. You've been running for hours to get to the place but now, you're sore and tired._

<br/>

> #### I Have an Idea!
>
> If anyone at the table has an idea for a good consequence, hear them out! It can be daunting as a GM to always know what happens in case of failure. That is true especially if luck isn't on the player's side, and you need to find lots of different consequences in the same session.
>
> As the GM, don't hesitate to ask your players for ideas as well. Someone might have a fascinating suggestion, but they think it's not their place to speak up. Prove to them otherwise.

## Safety Reminder

Just a quick reminder that if you come up with a consequence during a session, and someone at the table isn't comfortable with it, think of something else.

Pause the game, and make sure everyone is OK with what is happening in the fiction. Once everyone is on the same page, unpause and move forward with a different consequence.

Even with safety mechanics in place, accidents happen. That is why you should always be flexible when you inflict a consequence to the group.

## Recap

> #### Consequences
>
> If the result of an action roll is between `1-5`, the GM inflicts a **one** consequence:
>
> - **Reduced Effect** : reduce the `effect` of the action by one level.
> - **Complication**: create or tick a `danger clock` using the `consequence rating`.
> - **Worse Position** : reduce the `position` of the PC by one level for their next action rolls.
> - **Lost Opportunity** : what you tried didn't work, you need to use another `action`.
> - **Worse Condition**: take `1 stress` per consequence rating.

# Resistance Roll| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3c9ae5d526da51b44be1e7953077be51.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-battle-warrior-fire-falcon-3721894/)

**_Not on my watch!_**

If a character suffers a consequence that you, as a player, don't like, you can choose to resist it.

Simply tell the GM, "No, I don't think so. I'm resisting that."

The GM then tells you if resisting that consequence negates it completely, or simply reduces it.

- When negated, the PC is able to avoid the consequence entirely. e.g. they take no `stress`, no `danger clock` is ticked, etc.
- When reduced, the PC still suffers the consequence, but the effect of that consequence is reduced. e.g. they take 2 stress instead of 3, the danger clock only gets ticked once instead of twice.

> #### Avoiding vs Reducing Consequences
>
> By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of the game. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced if resisted.

You'll then make a `resistance roll` to see how much momentum your character consumes as a result of their resistance.

You make the roll using one of your character's `attributes pool`s (`Physique`, `Insight`, or `Resolve`).

That dice pool consists of `+1d6` for each dot in the first column on that attribute.

The GM chooses the attribute you use, based on the nature of the consequence:

- `Physique`: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
- `Insight`: Consequences from deception or understanding.
- `Resolve`: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.

When you resist consequences, you do it using charges of momentum. Getting a good roll consumes less charge, while bad rolls make you consume more of it.

| Result | Name               | Explanation                 |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `66`   | `Critical Success` | You gain `+1 momentum`.     |
| `6`    | `Full Success`     | You consume `-1 momentum`.  |
| `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You consume `-2 momentums`. |
| `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You consume `-3 momentums`. |

If you can't consume all the required charges of momentum, the GM inflicts 2 Consequences instead of one, and they cannot be resisted.

If you want, you can also resist a consequence that isn't targeting you directly . If you want to do so, see [**Team Work&nbsp;»&nbsp;Protect**](team-work#protect).

## Recap

> #### Resistance Rolls
>
> - Roll your Attribute Pool (Prowess, Insight, Resolve).
>   - On a `66`, gain `+1 momentum`
>   - On a `6`, consume `-1 momentum`
>   - On a ` 4-5`, gain `-2 momentums`
>   - On a `1-3`, gain `-3 momentums`
> - GM declares 2 consequences if you can't consume all the required charges. Those consequences cannot be resisted.

# Flashbacks | Mechanics

The rules don't distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When an operation is underway, you can invoke a `flashback` to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you went to a bar last night and befriended a couple of guards to make them drunk so that they call sick the next day. You do a `flashback` scene, and make a `Bond` roll to see how that went.

The GM sets a cost in `momentum` for you to activate the flashback.

- `0 momentum`: An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity.
- `1 momentum`: A complex action or unlikely opportunity.
- `2 (or more) momentum`: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies.

After the momentum is consumed, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there's some danger or trouble involved.

Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won't call for a roll at all because you can just consume the momentum and it's accomplished.

After the GM describes the trouble you're in, you can call for a flashback to a special preparation you made, "just in case" something like this happened. This way, your "flashback planning" will be focused on the problems that _do_ happen, not the problems that _might_ happen.

## Limits of flashbacks

A flashback isn't time travel. It can't "undo" something that just occurred in the present moment. If the GM described something in the scene, it is now established in the fiction.

While you can't undo what has already happened, you can twist and adapt things that were left unsaid.

For instance, if a maître d' is making a scene to stop you from entering at a very high end restaurant, that's perhaps because you `Swayed` them into doing this the night before in exchange for money to make a diversion for the rest of the group.

## Recap

> #### Flashback
>
> Use this to handle the unpredictable.
>
> - GM sets a cost in `momentum` (0-2) for you to do a `flashback` scene.
> - If necessary, make an `action roll` or a `fortune roll` to see what happens.

# Momentum | Mechanics

We've talked about the fact that characters have a `momentum` track, which starts with `2` charges at the beginning of every session.

We've also seen that momentum can be consumed to **boost** action rolls, **assist** allies, **lead** group actions, and do **flashback** scenes.

Now we will go over the different methods to gain momentum during scenes.

Basically, you can either gain momentum as a **result of an action roll**, or by **adding tension** to the scene.

## Momentum from an Action

Everytime you make an action roll, you have a chance of gaining new charges of `momentum`.

The reason why you start with only `2` at the beginning of a session is because we want players who are running low to engage with the game mechanics instead of sitting back because they are out of resources.

**The main way you get momentum back is by participating in the game.**

**By default**, you gain momentum when you make an action roll, and you rolled a `4`.

- If you rolled a ` 4-5`, you gain `+1 momentum`.
- If you rolled a `6`, you gain `+2 momentum`.
- If you rolled a `66`, you gain `+3 momentum`.

If you `push yourself` in a action roll, that roll won't generate `momentum`.

While this is the default setting, we encourage you and your group to change this as you wish. We want you to consider hacking this rule because it is the basis of the whole meta-economy of the game. Making momentum harder or easier to gain will have a big impact on the way the game plays out.

### Momentum Dial

Changing **when** and **how much** momentum is gained is called a `momentum dial`. Your group may decide to use the default setting provided by the game, since it is a good starting point. It is the default dial for a reason.

But if for example you want to emphasize the fact that life is hard and resources are scarce, then consider making momentum harder to gain. If on the other hand, you want to tell the story of characters who are all over-the-top, but still find a way to finish every adventure with their hat still sitting on their head, then consider making momentum easier to gain.

## Recap

> #### Momentum
>
> - Every time you make an `action roll`, you have a chance to gain `momentum`.

# Recovery | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/152570ee1895591ed40e267ac4eb35c1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-planet-futuristic-earth-5312500/)

**_Now, breathe..._**

As the game plays out, the PCs will get more stressed out and their condition will worsen.

When a PC accumulates `stress`, making action rolls will be more limited because of the narrative restrictions their `condition` creates.

The condition clock exists to pace the game, since not every action will go well, and failing an action has consequences which will affect the characters for some time.

Things will eventually go back to normal, and the PCs will recover. But for the recovery to happen, it needs to happen in the **fiction first**.

## Recovering in the Fiction

When a player wants their character to recover stress, there needs to be **Downtime** in the fiction.

If the group spends 3 sessions battling monsters in an epic dungeon, and tension is always through the roof, then the fiction doesn't allow for the recovery process to begin.

That being said, **Downtime** doesn't mean that all the PCs have to sit down by a campfire and talk until they are all at "full health".

The structure of a game of Charge isn't enforced, so the PCs can do what ever they want, whenever they want.

So **once** per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your `condition clock`.

We aren't using dice to support this mechanic because we don't believe luck should _generally_ factor in the healing process. Of course, there are moments where it could. If you want, you can use the [Fortune Roll](fortune-roll) mechanic to resolve this type of situation.

## Recap

> #### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your `condition clock`.

# Fortune Roll| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/66adea5dff68c16c02527472648c8110.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-sunset-planet-mars-heaven-5312660/)

**_The future is in constant flux._**

Not everything is about the proficiencies of the PCs. There are situations where something is simply up to chance. In those situations, the GM can call for a `fortune roll`.

_You are looking in the wreckage of a ship; is anybody left alive? You find a pistol on the ground; are there still bullets in it? Two factions are at war; who will win the final battle?_

To make a fortune roll, you need to assess the chances of a thing actually happening.

Is that thing likely or unlikely to happen? For each "likeliness" level, add `1d6` to the dice pool.

- If there's a 50% chance of success, roll `1d6`. If it's more than that, add more dice to the pool.
- If it's really unlikely, roll `2d6` and pick the worst.

If two forces are opposing one another, roll two opposing pools and take the best result of each to interpret who "won" and by how much.

Once the pool(s) are ready, throw the dice and interpret the results.

_There's someone left alive on the ship, and they are still breathing. There are bullets in the gun, but the gun itself is broken and can't be used._

Don't overthink this. This rule is vague by design, as it should not get in the way of the game. This mechanic is there to **quickly spice things up** during a scene.

```

# Team Work | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cdd5a6bc018b408a461740f0f4451a1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-moon-people-night-dream-6203763/)

**_It's dangerous to go alone, take this!_**

There are multiple ways player characters can help each other in Charge. They could **assist** each other, **take the lead** on an action, or perhaps **protect** another PC from danger.

## Assist

When you `assist`, you help another player who's making an action roll. Describe what your character does to help.

> **Consume `-1 momentum`**, and give them an additional `+1d6` for their roll.
>
> ---
>
> _I can't reach it, can you give me a boost?_

Be warned that, by doing this, you are also exposing yourself to possible consequences that this roll might end up creating.

## **Take the Lead**

When you `take the lead`, you coordinate multiple members of the group to tackle a problem together. Describe how your character is leading the group.

> Each player character who's involved makes an **action roll**. The team counts the **single best result** as the final result.
>
> The character leading the group action consumes `-1 momentum` for each PC that rolled **1-3** as their best result.
>
> ---
>
> _It's fine, I know the way. Just follow me. But don't make a sound, or you'll wake it up._

**The group action result covers everyone who rolled.** If you don't roll, your character doesn't get the effects of the action.

## Protect

You step in to confront a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene.

> **You suffer the consequence instead of them. You may roll to resist it as normal.**
>
> ---
>
> _Get behind my shield!_

## Set up

When you perform a setup action, you have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets `+1 effect` level or `improved position` for their roll.

You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

> **Make an action roll to improve the effect rating of a future action roll.**
>
> ---
>
> _First I'll distract them. Then you gotta make a run for it. OK?_

This is a good way to contribute to an operation when you don't have a good rating in the action at hand. A clever setup action lets you help the team indirectly. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup (including someone leading a group action) as long as it makes sense in the fiction.

### From Zero to Limited

Since a setup action can increase the effect of follow-up actions, it's also useful when the team is facing very tough opposition.

Even if the PCs are reduced to `zero effect` due to disadvantages in a situation, the setup action provides a bonus that allows for `limited effect`.

This gives them a fighting chance.

# Clocks| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/8aeb209f8442ddf2ed9dab425bd9b603.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/cave-fantastic-light-nature-6481713/)

A `clock` is a circle **divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments**. Draw a clock when you need to track an ongoing effort against an obstacle that cannot be resolved with a simple action roll.

Sneaking into a restricted area? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments the clock should have.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-segment clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

Segments of clocks are ticked after an action roll. The **effect and position rating** help decide how many segments should get ticked as a result of the roll.

Clocks should always be about the obstacle that needs to be overcome, and not be about the "how". The action of the character already takes care of explaining the "how".

Here are a couple examples of how clocks could be used to represent some situation that might arise during scenes.

> ### Progress Clocks
>
> These represent the ongoing effort of someone to achieve their goal. You tick this clock by using the `effect rating` of an action roll on successes.
>
> _How much money do we need before we can fix the ship? How much damage can the city withstand before there's nothing left to save?_
>
> ### Danger Clocks
>
> These represent the imminent danger about to face the player. You tick this clock by using the `position rating` of an action roll on consequences.
>
> _How long until they realize we are here? How much oxygen do we have left?_
>
> ### Opposing Clocks
>
> These represent the progress of two opposing parties to get to their goal. The effect and position ratings can both be used to tick one or the other clock.
>
> _Can we win the race against the fan favourite? Can we convince the judge that we are wrongly accused before the end of the trial?_

## Recap

# Progression | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/635caaef063a8652b3ce86a0ad3eeb7a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-clock-time-light-magic-3517206/)

**_That's something I'll never forget._**

In Charge, the characters are talented and proactive. After all, they are the protagonists of the story. If they fail at a task, it's _probably_ more because of unplanned circumstances than because of their lack of skills.

As time advances, the characters evolve and become more versatile, but this will only happen at certain `milestones`.

### Sessions

**At the end of each session**, each player can look at their character sheet and **update their character's details**.

You can use this opportunity to update their ties, appearance or even their concept if something important happened in the last session.

You aren't forced to do this, but you can view this like a friendly recurring reminder that you can do it.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Milestone

A `milestone` usually happens **at the end of a big event** in the story. This will _usually_ happen every 3-5 sessions.

The GM will probably feel when it's time for a milestone, but as a player you can always remind the GM "_Hey, this looked like an important event in the story, would this be a milestone?_".

Just go with what feels right and adapt if necessary.

When the group reaches a milestone, every character gets a new `talent` on their character sheet.

There are 4 types of talents a character can get when reaching this milestone:

- `+1 Action Dot`: You can increase any action on your character sheet by 1 dot.
- `+1 Effect when ____`: In a certain situation, the effect rating described by the GM is increased by 1.
- `+1 Position when ____`: In a certain situation, the position rating described by the GM is increased by 1.
- `+1d6 when_____` : In a certain situation, you can add `+1d6` to your dice pool.

Gaining a new talent will feel like a breath of fresh air. It won't make your characters overpowered or god-like, but it will make them more flexible, or more specialized.

> #### Progression Curve
>
> Just as a reminder, the longer it takes for a milestone to happen, the longer it will take for characters to become stronger.
>
> This is important to keep in mind depending on what kind of progression curve you want to have. Do you want to have a short campaign where characters will grow stronger pretty quickly, or are you looking for a year-spanning campaign where the characters will mostly evolve by changing their character details and where milestones will be more scarce?
>
> You could go as low as giving the player character only 2-3 Talents during an entire campaign, or reward them more often.
>
> There isn't a right or wrong answer here. It depends 100% on what kind of campaign you want to have. This is also something you can discuss with the group to make sure everyone has the same expectations.

### Situational Talents

Certain talents are situational. That is, they are only activated when you are in a **certain context** and using a **specific action**.

For example, when you get a `1 Effect when ____`, you will need to finish the end of that sentence by choosing one of the **12 Actions** and a certain **Situation** that will activate the talent.

Just look at what as already been established in the world, or your character's details, for inspiration.

To keep the flow of the game balanced, the GM will have a veto on what situation is good enough for your talent. Don't hesitate to experiment with this and fine-tune later if necessary.

The fact that writing up situational talents takes a bit of work is the reason why you don't get any talent when you create a fresh character.

We want character creation to be streamlined, so take the time to understand and discover who they are first. Later in the campaign, when a milestone occurs, you can then think of new ways to make them truly unique using talents.

_Yann's character is a monster hunter. Consequently, he's pretty good at **Studying** and **Brawling** in general. Yann also just got a new **talent dot** and would like to excel at tracking monsters specifically. Because monsters aren't encountered that frequently in the game, he asks the GM if his talent could be "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters**". The GM agrees. Now, Yann's character should be feared by most creatures roaming the lands._

_In another session, the GM realizes that Yann's talent is perhaps too generic, and could be tuned a little. He then asks if it could be rewritten as something like "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters in the forest**" or something along those lines. Yann agree saying "My character lived in the forest all their life, and would probably be intimated by big cities. I like it; let's go with this for now!"_

# Projects and Complications | Mechanics

The Charge character sheet has a `Projects & Complications` section which contains a set of empty `clocks`.

Those clocks represent long-term projects or ever-evolving danger that the character will work on or experience across multiple sessions.

## Long-term Projects

**_Perhaps your character is piling up money to be able to afford something good for their family, or perhaps they are trying to figure out a way to reverse the damaged caused by a dangerous new disease that's plaguing the city._**

In any case, once per session, if the narrative allows it, a character can make an action roll to work on those long-term projects. Those projects will be tracked using `progress clocks` on the character sheet. The `effect` rating of the roll determines how much the project progresses per session.

Upon the completion of a project, the PC gets what they were working for. The resolution of said project creates a new narrative thread explained by the GM. This thread is something the group can decide to pursue or not.

## Complication

**_Perhaps the police department is starting to realize there are missing pieces in the evidence locker, or perhaps you are starting to attract more and more heat on you and your crew after your last couple jobs._**

When a `complication` occurs as a result of a `consequence` of an action roll, the GM can tell the player to start or tick a `Danger Clock` on their character sheet.

Those complications aren't bound to the scene. Instead, they are tied to the character or the group as a whole.

Upon the completion of a complication's danger clock, the GM reveals a new dangerous situation to the group to represent what comes as a result of their actions.

Depending on the context, this new complication could be **imposed or exposed** to the group. **When imposed**, the characters need to resolve it as soon as possible. The story cannot continue without this being taken care of first. **When it is exposed**, the GM can foretell that the life of the group will be a bit more complicated because of a certain situation that comes from a result of the complication.

The goal here is to emphasize that every action elicits a reaction from the world, even if it isn't immediate.

# What are Extras | Extras

The content of the previous chapter contained every core rule needed to play Charge. With this, you are fully equipped to have a really fun time playing either just a quick one shot or a full-fledged year-spanning campaign.

Now, this next chapter is about **Extras**.

Extras are additional mechanics that you can add in your games to mimic certain types of gameplay or to tailor the game more to your liking.

# Asset Extra | Extras

Assets are an extra that you can use as an alternative to `pushing yourself` or `adding tension` to a scene to get a bonus die when making an action roll.

## Loot Assets

> For games that are about survival or that you want to resemble the "Looter and Shooter" genre.

The Loot Asset is an additional mechanic that gives you the chance to find good loot that will have a mechanical impact on the game when you scavenge a place.

After a conflict between multiple parties is resolved, or when the general tension in a scene is reduced, you can do a `fortune roll` with `Notice` to find good loot or to scavenge the place.

- On a `6`, you create `1 asset`.
- On a `66`, you create `2 assets`.

Take note of this asset on your character sheet, and use it when the time is right to get a `+1d6` or `increased effect` on an action roll.

If more than one player is scavenging, you can do a group roll using the `take the lead` mechanic.

> **Loot Roll**
>
> - Roll **Notice**.
>   - On a 1-5: nothing happens.
>   - On a 6: you create one asset
>   - On a critical (66): you create two assets.
> - If an asset was created, take note of it on someone's character sheet.

### Boon Asset

> For moments of great role-play

It's always amazing when a player loses themselves in their character, or has an amazing idea that is just too brilliant to ignore.

To make those moments shine even more, the GM can reward that player with an `asset`.

This is how the GM says: this was amazing, here's `+1d6` or `increased effect` for a future roll.

# Solo Extra | Extras

**By Valdy**

Sometimes you want to play a game with only one Player Character, and other moments you are alone or your team was taken out.

This extra is for these moments.

## The Last Standing Rule

> When you are alone, you are `the last standing`.
> If this happens, `pushing yourself` will only cost `1 momentum per push`.

### Why to use this?

This is intended to those moments when, you are by yourself, you are the last hope, and then you find a new flame that allows you to overcome the impossible odds stacked against you.

### Design considerations

I have a tendency to make one to one games (one GM and one player), and Charge revolves around Momentum being gained and spent.

Almost all mechanics about spending Momentum relies on having someone else available to assist you. So, by reducing the cost of Pushing Yourself, you allow for a higher flow of Momentum, which is more fair since no one can Assist, Take the Lead, and so on.

So, in short:

- If you are alone, you have fewer options to be awesome.
- So we reduce the cost of the remaining options.
- This allow Solo situations to be equally awesome.

# Making a Compelling Campaign | Preparing the Game

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b529142ada0e29c88323c82eec6c3ab.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-landscape-mountains-rock-6328992/)

You've got a GM and players. You're relatively comfortable with the basic mechanics, and you are ready to play Charge.

Amazing!

Now comes the important question that will affect everyone for the weeks/months to come: **what should the story be about, and how should it be played out?**

In the next chapter, we will go over how to find a good setting to play in, how to organize the campaign, and how to play it out.

These are merely suggestions and can be taken with a grain of salt.

Whether this is your first rodeo or not, we think those are good starting points to enjoy a good campaign in general.

This exercise should be done as a group, though some steps could be done solely by the GM, depending on what kind of game you want to have.

So first, you need to pick a setting.

## Finding a Setting

Charge is a generic game, so it doesn't come with a default world for you to play in. That means that we leave you the pleasure of talking with the rest of your group to find a setting that makes everyone at the table excited.

A good way to start the conversation is by asking the group to talk about their favourite media, e.g. books, video games, movies, TV shows, etc. If they can't think of anything, ask them what they watched/read/played recently.

For every media that is brought up, try to discuss what made it interesting. Was it the setting, the characters, the magic, the politics?

From there, take a piece of paper and list everything that is discussed. You might start to see a trend, like a specific genre that seems to interest most of the group.

Once people at the table run out of ideas, you can go over the list of all the suggestions and see if everyone can align on a specific existing setting.

## Establish the World

When the group is aligned on which setting they want to play in, it is important to do a quick refresher on the facts of this setting.

This is how we **establish the world**.

To do so, look at what makes this world unique and fire off questions around the table to make sure everyone is aligned on the answers.

If there's magic in the world: who can do it? what do you need to do it? what are the limitations? ...etc.
If you are in space: which galaxy are you in? are most planets terraformed? ...etc.

Not everything needs to be factualized. Otherwise, you would end up talking about lots of finicky little details for hours. This isn't the goal.

What isn't covered here will be covered later during a game session. The goal is mostly to get a general understanding of what is accessible and possible.

This exercise could prove to be a little bit more work if the group decided to make a brand new setting that isn't directly taken from existing media, but it can be very rewarding nonetheless.

## Add Trouble to the World

So, we now have all the main ingredients to make a great campaign, but we are missing one crucial thing: the spices.

We need to add some trouble in our world so that the campaign evolves interestingly overtime. Whether the player characters interact with those events is another subject, but what we want to do is make the world feel real.

This can be done as a group, but could also be done by the GM alone.

It really depends on what type of game you want to play. Do you want everything about the story to be transparent to everyone, or do you prefer that the GM think of these things on their side and keep some surprises for the group?

Your table, your call.

So, to make the world feel real, we define 1-3 `World Forces`.

> A `Force` is something or someone with goals looking to change the status quo in significant and narratively interesting ways.

We are using the term `Force` here instead of enemy, foe, or big bad, because a force isn't necessarily a person.

That's why you shouldn't always think of a force as something that will go toe-to-toe against the PCs.

It is entirely up to the PCs how they want to interact with the World Forces. The group could be opposed to some, allied with others, and neutral about the rest.

> A `Force` could be a Person, but it could also be an Organization, a Country, a Planet, Mother Nature, or the Space-Time Continuum!

Once you have found one or two interesting `World Forces`, you need to think about their `Goal`.

Their goal defines the impact the force will have on the world. A goal isn't necessarily good or bad— it is merely what the force wants to accomplish. It can also be considered as "good" by the Force itself, but others might have different view on the subject.

> A `Goal` could be to take back the throne, protect the galaxy from thieves and thugs, or to open a portal that connects to another world.

Now that we have a `Force,` and that force has a `Goal`, let's find out how they interact with the world to achieve said goal. We do this by defining their `Methods`.

A Force's Methods represents what they do to get closer to their goal. Each Force has around `2-3 Methods`.

> `Methods` could be things like trying to recruit people in an army, trying to corrupt government officials, or increasing the military surveillance over a certain artifact.

You can repeat this exercise as many times as you want depending on how many starting forces you want to have in your world.

Each `Force` will then live inside your world, and as the players interact with the world, the forces do too.

As time advances, they will act with their `Methods`, which will get them closer or further away from their `Goals`.

> #### Force Example
>
> **The Rebel Forces** want to **get rid of the usurper that sits on the throne by:**
>
> - _Finding dirt on the government to expose corruption._
> - _Convincing the real king to take back what is theirs._
> - _Finding money to hire mercenaries to fight an eventual war._

## Define the Group as a Force

Now that we've added more life into our world, we can determine what the group is all about.

Doing this is pretty straightforward. Simply do the exact same exercise we did above, but now the Force we are creating represents the group of player characters.

To define the group as a `Force`, all the players need to align on what they are about. To do this, they should look back at the `World Forces` and decide how they feel about them. Are they aligned, neutral, or against the different Goals of those Forces?

That's why we defined the `World Forces` before the `Player Force`.

Once the players have a general idea of what their group is about, write a `Force`, a `Goal`, and 2-3 `Methods` that represent them.

# What to Hack | Hacking the Game

 <p style="font-size:3rem; text-align:center; margin:0;">👷‍♀️ 🚧 🚧 🚧 👷</p>

You've read the rules and best practices, and your first thought is:

**_This is great! Now, how can I hack this ?_**

Great!

Charge comes with a default set of rules, but most of them can be altered to **help you make each game your own**.

This chapter provides some guidelines about what is hackable by design. It also provides some ideas on how to design new mechanics around what is already in place to keep the "Charge feeling".

## Hacking Character Details

The character's details section is possibly the easiest section to change since it doesn't impact the mechanic, or the balance of the game.

By default, a character is defined by short descriptors called `details`.

They have a `concept` to explain who they are, an `appearance` to know what they look like, and `ties` to link them to the world.

### Changing the Details

To make your own details, think of what is important in your setting.

If your setting heavily focuses on which god the PCs worship, than add a `God` detail. If characters have a specific role in the group, add a detail for this as well.

While those descriptors aren't _really_ used by the game mechanics, they are still relevant in highlighting **what is important in your game**.

## Hacking the Actions

Another great way of to adapting Charge is by changing the standard `12 actions`.

### Changing the Words

Words are important. When carefully chosen, they help convey a meaning.

Charge comes with a default set of generic actions. Because they are generic, they might not necessarily fit with the setting you've chosen.

If some of those words feel off, rename them.

Replace `Tinker` by `Craft` or `Hack`. Or replace `Sway` by `Negotiate` or `Argue`.

Even a small change in word can affect the underlying tone of what the action does.

Use this to evoke a genre, and highlight the risky actions that the PCs will be doing.

### Changing the Number of Actions

If you feel like 12 actions to memorize is too much, you can reduce the list to 9 or even 6 actions.

Reducing the number of actions also means that each action will cover more use-cases. Take that in consideration when choosing your action words.

Also think about the **maximum action rating** (default is 4) and the **starting number of action dots** (default is 7) character gets at the beginning of a game.

## Hacking Momentum

As mentioned in [**ealier**](momentum#momentum-dial), momentum is pretty much hackable by default because of the existence of the `momentum dial`.

When you start a new campaign, check if the default momentum dial feels good for you and your group.

Do you have a feeling that PCs gain momentum too often ? Or do you think that when it is gained, the amount gained should be more generous ? There is no golden hammer here, every story is different.

To make your own `momentum dial`, simply look at **when** momentum is generated. Then look at **how much** momentum is gained when it's generated.

Tweak those two variables until things feel right.

## Hacking Talents

Talents exists to make character progression interesting. The talent tree makes character a bit stronger, but mostly it makes them more versatile.

### Changing the Tree

A way you can hack talent is by changing the content of the talent tree. By default, a talent either gives you a **new action dot**, or a **situational bonus**.

You could change the content of that tree to make certain types of talent more common than others. You could also create brand new types of talent that would make players more invested in your game.

### Changing When Talent Dots are Gained

Talent dots are usually gained after narrative `milestones`. Depending on the genre, you could alter this and make talent dots gained in different scenarios.

A player could gain a talent dot when they fail `desperate` roll, or when they finish a `project` clock on their character sheet.

Talents are a great player incentive, so hacking this is an easy way to reinforce behaviors you want your players to do.

### Changing the Cost of Activating a Talent

You can also change the cost of using a talent. By default, talents are free to invoke, but it doesn't have to be.

An easy cost to set for activating a talent would be using momentum.

If you set a cost of `1 momentum`, talents could be seen as a way to get bonuses at a cheaper cost than `pushing oneself`.

If you set a cost of `2 momentum` for a talent, then consider giving a bigger bonus than what a a usual `push` would give.

Just remember to keep things fair!

## Hacking Conditions

A PC's condition acts as a combat pacing mechanism, but also as a way to represent the character's current health condition.

### Changing Condition Clock

If characters in your world are supposed to be weaker to tougher, change the number of segments in the condition clock.

This is an easy change that has a big impact on in-game challenges.

Be warned that having bigger condition clocks can make conflicts drag for longer. This can either be a good, or bad thing, depending on what you're going for.

### Changing Recovery

Another important detail about condition is that they are supposed to recover after a time.

By default, a condition clocks recovers **one segment per session**, if the fiction allows it.

You could offer other opportunities to PCs to get better. Perhaps by going to see a doctor, or by interacting with the "medic" of the group.

Doing this will affect what the PCs do immediately after big battles, because they usually don't like staying "hurt" for a long time.

> #### Luck Based Recovery
>
> Be weary of making recovery based on luck.
>
> If you use action or fortune rolls to recover, a couple of bad rolls in a row can make for quite a couple of uninteresting session for a player.
>
> That's something that we _usually_ want to try to avoid.

### Introducing Penalties

Apart from narrative limitations, conditions don't inflict penalties on characters. This is by design.

In Charge, we prefer to encourage good behaviors than to give punishment for simply having played the game. The game is about rewarding interactions, and pacing failures.

That doesn't mean that we want to discourage you from doing something different in your game.

We mostly want to highlight why Charge is the way it is so that you take it in consideration when designing new modifications to the rules.

### Introducing Deterioration

For some types of games, you might also want to consider if conditions can get worse if the PCs ignore them.

Things like poison or untreated wounds can make a character's life harder over time.

For this, you could think of ways of making condition clocks "auto-advance" based on certain triggers. Figure out what those triggers are and how many segments are ticked when they happen.

You should also think of opportunities for players to take care of those deteriorations so that they stop being inflicted upon their characters.

# Making Playbooks | Hacking the Game

<p style="font-size:3rem; text-align:center; margin:0;">👷‍♀️ 🚧 🚧 🚧 👷</p>

In Charge, we don't offer a list of playbooks, archetypes or classes for the players to choose from when starting a new game. This is because we want players to be able to create the character they want to, without limiting their creativity.

This doesn't mean that they shouldn't exists. Playbooks are an amazing solution to the blank page syndrome when creating a character.

With a bit of preparation, the game master can create a set of playbooks for their players to choose from. Designers who want to use Charge as the framework of their game can also use this method for their game.

## Playbook Recipe

Here's a recipe on how to create a playbook for Charge using the default character sheet as a basis for it.

### Details

Find a name for your playbook. Once you have a good catchy name, write it down as the character's `concept`.

Leave the `appearance` box empty for the player to fill. Also write down a list of possible `ties` for the player to choose from when they make their character.

### Actions

Each playbook should have 3 action dots pre-assigned on the default sheet. This helps the player understand what this class of character is good at by default.

This leaves 4 action dots that they can assign wherever they want to make their implementation of that playbook their own.

### Talents

Each playbook should feel a bit different to play from one another.

In the `talents` section, pre-fill the situational talents by things that make sense for that playbook.

### Rinse and Repeat

Once you've done one playbook, just repeat the process a couple of time to offer different archetypes to your players.

This should help your players find interesting ideas for their characters since constraints are known to aid with creativity.

# In a Nutshell

> The number of stress inflicted depends on the action's `position`:
>
> - `Controlled`: `+1 stress`
> - `Risky`: `+2 stress`
> - `Desperate`: `+3 stress`
>
> Each stress ticks a segment on a PC's condition clock. When you mark stress, you also need to add/update your `condition`.
>
> When the clock is filled, your character is taken out for the scene and your condition clock is cleared.

> ### Projects and Complications
>
> Use these Clocks when a player has a long-term project or when the GM inflicts a complication as a `consequence`.

## Doing Things

> ### Action Roll
>
> Use this when someone, or something, is in your way.
>
> 1. Pick an `action` and find how many dice you need to roll.
> 1. Determine the `position` (`1 controlled` ► `2 risky` ► `3 desperate`)
> 1. Determine the `effect rating` (`3 great` ► `2 standard` ► `1 limited`)
> 1. Choose one:
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `push yourself` (`-2 momentum`)
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `add tension` to the action.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `-1 momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
> ---
>
> _If you don't have any action dots and can't `push yourself`, `add tension`, or `request assistance`, roll `2d6` and take the worst result._
>
> ---
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                                                       |
> | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You greatly overcome the obstacle.                                |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You overcome the obstacle.                                        |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.           |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You fail at overcoming the obstacle, and there's a `consequence`. |
>
> ### Resistance Roll
>
> Use this to resist a consequence, or incoming `stress`.
>
> - Roll `1d6` for each dot in the first column of an attribute:
>   - `Physique`: Consequences from physical strain or injury.
>   - `Insight`: Consequences from deception or understanding.
>   - `Resolve`: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                |
> | ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You gain `+1 momentum`.    |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You consume `-1 momentum`. |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You consume `-2 momentum`. |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You consume `-3 momentum`. |
>
> If you can't consume all the required `momentum`, the GM inflicts `2 consequences` instead of one, and they cannot be resisted.
>
> ### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your condition clock.

## Team Work

> ### Take the Lead
>
> Use this to carry the group with your leadership and skills.
>
> - Leader describes how they take the lead, and consumes `-1 momentum`.
> - Everyone makes an `action roll`; the best result counts as the group's result.
> - The leader consumes `-1 momentum` for each player that got a `1-3` as their best result.
> - The leader doesn't get momentum from the result of that action.
>
> ### Assist
>
> Use this to help a fellow PC accomplish their action.
>
> - Consume `-1 momentum` and add `+1d6` to their roll.
> - This also exposes the helper to any potential consequences resulting from the roll.
>
> ### Protect
>
> Use this to protect a fellow PC from danger.
>
> - Roll to resist someone else's consequence.
>
> ### Set up
>
> Use this to improve your chances at overcoming an obstacle.
>
> - Roll to improve the `effect` rating or the `position` of subsequent action rolls made by your team.

## Misc

> ### Progression
>
> Use this to make characters evolve and get stronger over time.
>
> #### Session
>
> - Happens every session.
> - Update the details of your character if necessary.
>
> #### Milestone
>
> - Happens every 3-5 sessions, usually after a big event.
> - Gain `+1 Talent Dot`
>
> ### Consequences
>
> Use this when there's a `bad outcome` on a PC's Action Roll.
>
> Select one of the following:
>
> - The `effect` of the roll is reduced.
> - A narrative `complication` occurs (you can track this on the character sheet).
> - The opportunity is lost and the PC must try a new approach.
> - The `position` worsens.
> - The PC takes `stress`:
>   - `+1 stress` for a `controlled` position
>   - `+2 stress` for a `risky` position
>   - `+3 stress` for a `desperate` position
>
> ### Fortune Roll
>
