# Introduction | Breathless SRD

![Breathless SRD](https://gyazo.com/0f40d43a7d0f357b04833aa520703564.png)

This is the Breathless SRD. A free and open licensed version of Breathless that contains all the rules and design guidelines for you to make your own Breathless game.

Breathless games focus on condensed simplicity. The rules, the setting, the rolling tables, and the character sheet all fit on a half-fold brochure. This makes it easy for anyone to print your game at home, and get started with nothing more than a set of polyhedral dice and a few pens.

Characters are talented and proactive. But the path that lies in front of them is perilous. They will face difficult tasks, try to catch their breath, scavenge what they can find, and try to get through in one piece.

# The Game | Breathless SRD

## Before We Start

Content Warning: [...]

Before you start, define lines that should not be crossed. Pause or rewind the game if something uncomfortable happens during a session. Always make sure everyone is comfortable with the direction of the story.

## Playing The Game

One person is the game master (GM), the rest are players.

**GM**: Guide the story, present challenges to the group. Be a fan of the players. Ask them questions, fill the world with their answers. If it's cool, let them try or split complex challenges into multiple checks.

**Player**: Narrate what your character does. Make checks when things are risky. Give everyone a time to shine. Fill the world with your ideas. Take risks, and rise up from failures.

## Checks

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, you make a check to see how it plays out. You only need to roll if what you are doing is risky.

The GM telegraphs the risk of your action, you then pick a skill, and roll the die that matches its rating. If an ally helps you, they also make a check, but share the same risks as you. Take the highest die and interpret the results.

- On a 1-2, you fail, and something wrong happens.
- On a 3-4, you succeed, but at a cost.
- On a 5+, you succeed. The higher the result, the better the effect.

Surviving is hard. Everyone who rolled reduces the rating of the skill they used by one level: d12 » d10 » d8 » d6 » d4. Skills cannot go lower than a d4.

The GM can disclaim decision-making by testing for luck. To do so, pick a die rating simply based on the odds of a thing happening, roll, and interpret the results.

## Catch Your Breath

To reset all your skills to their original rating, you can ask to “catch your breath”. This is a brief break in tension. It can be done at any time, even during combat.
When a character catches their breath, the GM looks at the scene and introduces a new complication to the group.

## Loot Checks

When the fiction allows it, you can make a loot check to scavenge for tools, weapons, med kits, etc. Be careful of what is lurking in the shadow.
When you do a loot check, roll a d20.

- On a 1, something bad happens.
- On a 15-16, you find a d6 item.
- On a 17-18, you find a d8 item.
- On a 19-20, you find a d10 item —or— a med kit.

## Backpack

Items in your backpack can be used in place of your skills. They start with a die rating which decreases after each use. When reduced to a d4, the item either breaks, gets lost, or fades away from the fiction until it’s made relevant again.

Characters can only carry 3 items and one med kit at once in their backpack.

## Stunts

When you pull off a stunt, you use a d12 instead of a skill rating to do a check. Once used, you'll need to "catch your breath" to use it again.

## Stress

When you face a consequence as a result of one of your actions, the GM can decide that you take 1 stress. If your character reaches 4 stress, they become “vulnerable”.

When vulnerable, failing a dangerous action could mean being taken out —or— sudden death.

You can use up a med kit to clear 2 stress, or lay low someplace secure awhile to clear 1 stress.

## Your Character

On your character sheet, write down your character’s name and pronouns.
By default, skills have a d4 rating. Assign a d10, a d8, and a d6 to three skills you think your character is good at.
Characters have a total of 6 skills:

- Bash: wreck, move, force.
- Dash: run, jump, climb.
- Sneak: hide, skulk, lurk.
- Shoot: track, throw, fire.
- Think: perceive, analyze, repair.
- Sway: charm, manipulate, intimidate.

Think of an item that you got before leaving for your adventure, and add it to your backpack as a d10 item.

# Designer Notes | Breathless SRD

Here are some guidelines you can use when making your own Breathless game.

## Your Setting

Explain briefly the setting, and what the story is mainly going to focus on. Touch on what sort of challenges the PCs will encounter. Go over what is their purpose, and why they are part of the same group.

## Your “Catch Your Breath”

The core mechanics centers around characters breathless from overcoming obstacles. It doesn’t mean that your game should revolve around survival, though. Look into when or how characters should “catch their breath”. Can they do it all the times, do they need to rest, or be in a specific location? Think about what is the “cost” of the characters catching their breath, for every mechanic should move the story forward.

## Your Loot

The loot checks give a way for players to make an attempt at gaining assets that will make their life easier, and will reduce the rate at which they get tired. Keep in mind that doing this is not 100% risk-free. Your game could use this to handle items, but you could also simulate other types of bonuses using this mechanic.

## Your Skills and Classes

To make this game your own, you should customize the skill list to something that better fit the aesthetic of your setting. Another way to do this is to provide classes/archetypes for the players to choose from, where each class could have pre-assigned skills or items.

## Your Stunts

The default Stunt mechanic is a tool players can use to look “awesome” once per "catch your breath". Use this to mimic characters using cool powers or doing something extremely lucky.

## Your Stress

Stress is the default health pacing mechanism of the game. If you want characters to feel stronger or weaker, adjust how big is the stress track, what happens when a PC fills it, and how they can recover. Be as generous or harsh as you see fit.

## Your Rolling Tables

Consider adding rolling tables for the things you consider important in your game. Since this game’s format is short, rolling tables help in two-way. First, they help put a bigger focus on what is significant in your world. Second, they help facilitate sessions for when the players are in doubt about where the story should go next. Plus, it does all this in a very word efficient way. You could include tables for things like items, locations, allies, enemies, complications, missions, etc.

# Declare a Truth | Gasps (Extras)

## Introduction

Declare a Truth is a Gasp designed by René-Pier Deshaies-Gélinas of Fari RPGs used in [Renegades](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/renegades) that allows player more control over the narrative, but like most things Breathless, it might come at a cost.

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/1558885?linkback=true&amp;bg_color=ffffff&amp;fg_color=222222&amp;link_color=fa5c5c&amp;border_color=c9c9c9" width="100" height="167"><a href="https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/renegades">Renegades by Fari RPGs</a></iframe>

## Rule

When the situation is dire, or if you are looking for a way out, you can declare a new truth about the world. If your fact is a small truth, it just happens, but for big truths the GM adds a “but...” afterwards.

The GM gets the final say on this, so work with them to make sure your fact works well with what has already been established. Once used, you'll need to "catch your breath" to declare a new truth.

> ### Designer Notes
>
> This simple mechanic gives players a lot of control over the story, and will encourage them to roll less often, since declaring a truth is easier than using a skill. In order to prevent players from becoming too reliant on this, they can only use it once per "catch your breath". In your game, you might want to rely on another meta-currency or require the players to be in certain situations before they can declare a new truth. The GM can always decide to throw bigger problems at the scene if they feel the new truth is too big, so this usually balance things out fine.

# Crafting | Gasps (Extras)

Crafting is a Gasp designed by Liv Merryman of Liv’s Game Corner, used in _The Last of Us_ to simulate the post-apocalyptic scavenging (using Breathless loot checks) and crafting of gear that appears in the video games of the same name. This Gasp is generalized for adaptation into whatever context you desire for your system.

<iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/1556993" width="100%" height="167" frameborder="0"><a href="https://livsgamecorner.itch.io/the-last-of-us%22%3EThe Last of Us by livsgamecorner</a></iframe>

## Rule

Once you have some scavenging materials (which you can gain via Breathless’s base rules for Loot Checks), you can craft useful materials you’ll need to survive. Based on how well players do on loot checks, they’ll be able to collect anywhere from ⅓ of a material to a full material. They’ll need full materials to craft items.

Players can carry up to three crafted items at once, as they will count as items in your Backpack. In appropriate situations, they can be used in place of your skills in order to make checks. They each get a die rating, which reduces over time just like skill checks. Once they reach the d4 tier, the item breaks, is lost, or otherwise disappears from use or the story.

Aside from the listed items, you may figure out other things you can craft with the stuff you find scavenging. Decide between players and GM what the rating of the item is, as well as its function. Improvisation is encouraged!

> ## Designer Notes
>
> As the system designer, you’ll need to decide what scavenging materials work best for your system. In _The Last of Us_, there are 6: Alcohol, Adhesive, Blade, Cloth, Explosive, and Shroud. I don’t recommend more than 6, as you’ll keep track of the amounts of scavenging materials you have on your character sheet.
>
> Below are some crafted item examples from _The Last of Us_, as well as their uses. You’ll have to decide what the use of each item is in the context of gameplay, as well as a reasonable starting dice rating for that item.
>
> **DIY Medkit**
>
> - Materials: 1 Alcohol, 1 Cloth
> - This removes 2 Stress from 1 Survivor’s Stress meter. Starting rating of d10.
>
> **Shiv**
>
> - Materials: 1 Adhesive, 1 Blade
> - This can be used to kill an Infected or another enemy without being noticed. Can also be used to pick locks. Starting rating of d8.
>
> **Nail Bomb**
>
> - Materials: 1 Blade, 1 Explosive
> - A can of blades that can damage a group of enemies. Rating of d10, decays to d4 immediately.

# Adventure Frame | Gasps (Extras)

Adventure Frame is a Gasp designed by René-Pier Deshaies-Gélinas of Fari RPGs used in [Renegades](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/renegades) that easily allows the creation of adventure modules for Breathless games.

<iframe frameborder="0" width="100%" src="https://itch.io/embed/1558885?linkback=true&amp;bg_color=ffffff&amp;fg_color=222222&amp;link_color=fa5c5c&amp;border_color=c9c9c9" width="552" height="167"><a href="https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/renegades">Renegades by Fari RPGs</a></iframe>

## Rule

The Adventure Frame format divides the plot into many events that the player characters (PCs) will need to resolve in order to move forward with the story. This format gives you just enough flavor to get started while keeping things flexible for when players will do something unexpected.

When bad rolls appear, or when you need to raise tension, introduce new complications, but if none directly matches the fiction, take a random one and adapt it to the story. There is no wrong way to play this, so if the players don’t follow the events to the letter, find a new way to stitch things back together later.

### The Premise

_{Premise short description.}_

### 1. {Event Name}

_{Event short description.}_

**Goal:** {2-3 goals for the players to accomplish.}

**Scene:** {3-5 descriptors for the GM to get a sense of the scene.}

**Complications:** {2-3 complications for the GM to use in case something bad happens}

> ### Designer Notes
>
> Adventure Frames have been designed especially for Breathless games. Since no plot survives an encounter with the players, Adventure Frames focus on goals, scene descriptors, and complications. This leaves a lot of space for the GM to change the story on the fly, and just glue things back together when necessary.

# Survivor Points | Gasps (Extras)

Survivor Points is a Gasp designed by Andrew Boyd of Pandion Games that allows characters to become better suited and potentially survive longer in harsh environments.

<iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/1518935" width="100%" height="167" frameborder="0"><a href="https://pandiongames.itch.io/substratum">SUBSTRATUM by Pandion Games</a></iframe>

## Rule

This advancement system is written to be used with Breathless by Fari RPGs and any game game based on Breathless. While many Breathless games are purposefully difficult, Survivor Points allows your characters to become better suited and potentially survive longer in their new found environment.

### Earning Survivor Points

Earn one Survivor Point for each Stress you end the session with. Survivor Points can accumulate.

### Spending Survivor Points (SP)

Survivor Points can be spent in two ways: Before the Session and During the Session.

### Before the Session

- Skill Advancement (once per session) - Spend 1 SP to increase a Skill by 1 rating up to a max of d10. Each additional Skill Advancement costs an additional 1SP.
- Item Improvement - Spend 1 SP to increase an Item you hold by 1 rating (max of d10).
- Stress Reduction - Spend 1 SP to remove 2 Stress.

### During the Session

- Stress Reduction - Spend 1 point to remove 1 Stress.
- Avoid Consequences - When you roll or take an action that would incur a consequence, spend 1SP and avoid it instead.
- Adrenaline - Spend 1SP to fully recharge 1 Skill without a consequence.

# Flashback | Gasps (Extras)

Flashback is a Gasp designed by Patrick Dubuc of Tiki Games used in Crank It Up! that allows the player to recount a situation that took place in the past that has the potential to change the current scene.

(Crank It Up! is not released yet!)

## Rule

A _flashback_ can be triggered anywhere, anytime as long as it is declared and only one _flashback_ is allowed per player/per session. It allows a player to add a new information that becomes true and now exists in the game world. The GM must now take this new information into account.

To determine to which extent did the player's Flashback is accurate, the GM rolls a D12:

On a 1-2, the Flashback is highly inaccurate and the GM can use the new information provided to introduce a complication.
On a 3-4, the Flashback is fairly accurate but the GM can introduce a complication (if desired).
On a 5+, the Flashback is 100% accurate and the higher the result, the better it helps in the current scene.

> ### Designer Notes
>
> This simple mechanic is similar in purpose as Declare A Truth but with a more random outcome. It gives players some limited control over the story as it unfolds. Letting a Flashback occur only once per player/per gaming session is a way to prevent players from relying solely on the fact that they "can change the story". If, as a gamemaster you think that once per gaming session is too harsh, you can choose to raise the number of times that the Gasp can be used per gaming session OR allow it to recharge when "Catching Your Breath".
>
> Example: In a playtest, my son used his cellphone to contact a powerful ally. Without wishing to railroad him, I decided that he was not going to answer the phone. He used his Flashback to recall that that ally had also a pager for emergencies and that he always answer messages on his pager, no matter what ... So in the end, he was able to reach his ally and ask for a favor.

## Attribution

This game uses mechanics based off the Flashback Gasp, designed by Patrick Dubuc of Tiki Games.

# Transformation | Gasps (Extras)

Transformation is a Gasp designed by Nick Potter of Sustain a Spell used in _Let's Be Magical!_ that models empowering transformations for magical girl, super sentai, or other similar character types.

<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/1571203?linkback=true&amp;bg_color=FFC1E5&amp;border_color=eafdff" width="100%" height="167"><a href="https://sustain-a-spell.itch.io/lets-be-magical">Let's Be Magical! by Sustain a Spell</a></iframe>

## Rule

When you transform, you are filled with power and confidence. All of your skills increase by one level while transformed, and lower one level when your transformation ends. If any of your skills are at a d4 by the time you end your transformation or if you Catch Your Breath while transformed, you take one point of stress.

> ### Designer Notes
>
> This mechanic is intended to provide a mechanical representation of the battle transformations seen in anime or sentai — it can be magical girls, Power Rangers, Super Saiyans, or any other sort of powerup meant for battle.
>
> It obviously provides a power boost, and can help the players tackle harder obstacles and challenges, but it comes with the downside of possible Stress and limiting Catch Your Breath opportunities.
>
> You can feel free to alter it as you wish, introducing threats that can only be taken while transformed, or removing the drawback entirely to just add a bit of a power fantasy to the game.

## Attribution

This game uses mechanics based off the Transformation Gasp, designed by Nick Potter of Sustain a Spell.
