# Introductions

This document follows a certain format that you can use as a base framework for your game, but also offers design advice so that you can hack it while still keeping the HOPES & DREAMS feeling.

You can fill-in the gaps, or tear-it down to make something completely different.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this. Enjoy!

# The Game

In this game, you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional characters facing, and trying to overcome obstacles. You decide how the characters resolve those challenges, and how the world reacts to those actions.

## What You Need To Play

Here’s what you’ll need to play:

- Between two and five people. One of them acting as the Game Master.
- Character sheets, one for each player.
- A bunch of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- Index cards, sticky notes or similar slips of paper.

## Content Warning

We want to take a moment to be transparent about the themes present in this game. If some of them make you or anyone at your table uncomfortable, it's important to talk about it as a group. You can then decide to either remove them from your game or play something else. Stay safe and be empathetic with everyone you are playing with.

This game includes references and expressions of the following themes: [...]

> #### Designer Note: Content Warning
>
> Take the time to fill out the themes present in your game with the section above. Being transparent will go a long way to ensure a safe playing experience for everyone at the table.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or `NPCs`.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or `PCs`.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful, and captivating.

## Game Structure

To play this game, you meet-up with other people either in real life or online to collaborate on creating an interesting story together.

Each `session` is its own unique experience and is made of multiple `scenes` stitched together, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what their characters do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of dice rolls.

We roll dice because we want to be on the edge of our seats. We want to be surprised by where the story takes us next.

## Safety Tools

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important, and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

# Character Creation

To make your character, write down their name, their nickname, and what they look like on your character sheet.

## Actions

The way your character interacts with the world is via their `ACTIONS`. When a PC wants to do something risky, they use one of the 12 `ACTIONS` listed below to try and resolve the situation.

- `MUSCLE`: wreck, move, force.
- `FINESSE`: maneuver, misguide, fool.
- `MOVE`: run, jump, swim, climb.
- `SNEAK`: hide, skulk, lurk.
- `SHOOT`: track, throw, shoot.
- `TINKER`: build, repair, hijack.
- `STUDY`: gather information, analyze, scrutinize.
- `NOTICE`: perceive, observe, anticipate.
- `BOND`: reassure, socialize, connect.
- `COMMAND`: lead, order, intimidate.
- `SWAY`: influence, charm, manipulate.
- `FOCUS`: concentrate, calculate, mediate.

All characters have actions they excel at, this is called being `SKILLED`.

To decide which action your character is `SKILLED` at, you first choose a `KIT`.

`KITS` are character presets that come with `2 SKILLED ACTIONS` and special `ABILITIES` that you can use to make powerful stunts.

Characters are skilled in `3 ACTIONS` in total. Your `KIT` is `SKILLED in 2`, but you get to decide what is the last action your character is skilled at.

## Hopes

The `HOPE` of a character is used to represent what fuels them to achieve their goals. All characters have a `HOPE TRACK` that gets filled when they succeed risky actions. Players can then spend that `HOPE` to get bonuses when facing new challenges.

## Dreams

Once everyone has a general idea of what kind of character they are going to play, you all need to decide on what is the main short-term goal of the group. In this game, we call this the group’s `DREAM`.

The `DREAM` is what drives the characters forward in the story. This isn’t something that is given to them, it’s something that drives them and ignites their hearts.

Once you’ve chosen a `DREAM`, one of the players can write it down on their character sheet for safe keeping. That character is called the HEART OF THE GROUP. They aren’t the leader, but they are responsible for keeping the group’s `DREAM` alive.

Some of the game’s mechanics mark boxes on the `DREAM` TRACK to represent the progress that the group is making towards their `DREAM`.
When the group's `DREAM TRACK` is completed, the GM fast forwards in time and narrates how the story and the world changed thanks to the PCs. Accomplishing a `DREAM` also gives all the PCs a new `ABILITY` that they can choose from their respective `KITS`.

After that, the group finds a new `DREAM`, and the cycle starts over.

## Harm

When a PC gets hurt or stressed as a result of one of their actions, they take `HARM`. Each character has an `HARM TRACK` with 5 boxes to represent how injured they are.

If at any point your `HARM TRACK` is filled, you are taken out and the rest of the scene continues without you.

The only way to recover from `HARM` is in-fiction. You can either rest, lay low or seek medical attention. When doing so, the GM will look at the fiction and tell you how much (1-5) you recover.

## Abilities

A character’s `ABILITIES` are special talents that are unique to each KIT. They either give a mechanical advantage in certain situations, or allow a new narrative liberty.

Each character starts with 1 `ABILITY`. The group will gain `1 ABILITY` for each `DREAM` they are able to achieve.

# Mechanics

## Tests & Challenges

During scenes, the PCs might encounter risky situations that they will try to resolve. Some might be handled quickly, while others may require more effort.

Simple tasks are called `TESTS` and are resolved with a single dice `CHECK`. The GM explains the risk, dice are rolled, results are interpreted and we move on.

Complex tasks are called `CHALLENGES` and require multiple `CHECKS` before they are resolved. After the GM has explained what the `CHALLENGES` is, the group is going to do numerous dice rolls until the challenge is complete.

To track the progress of a `CHALLENGE`, we create a TRACK of boxes which the PCs fill as they work towards resolving that obstacle.

## Tracks

In this game, enemies don’t have hit points, abilities or powers. They are merely viewed as obstacles that need to be overcome. To represent those obstacles, we use `TRACKS`.

A `TRACK` is a row with 3, 5, 8 or 13 boxes that you mark from left to right. Every time you check off a box, the track is one step closer to being resolved.

There are two types of `TRACKS`.

- CHALLENGE TRACKS are used to represent challenges that the group needs to handle, like fighting a group of enemies or entering a well secured compound.
- DANGER TRACKS are used for escalating threats like a group of guards that is about to be alerted by your presence, or the time left until a bomb explodes.

### Fibonacci Sequence

The number of boxes for `TRACKS` aren’t arbitrary. They follow the Fibonacci Sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc) where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

The reason for this is that according to Weber’s Law, the difference we can identify between objects is given by a percentage. If that percentage is too low, differentiating two things becomes harder.

By making each `TRACK` size around 60% bigger than the previous one, deciding each one to use becomes a easier. Doing this speeds up the game and keeps the group focused on what is important; the fiction.

## Checks

When a player character tries to do something risky, we make a `CHECK` to determine how it plays out.  If what the PC is trying to accomplish is something we would just expect them to do, there is no need for a `CHECK`. The GM just narrates what happens, and the story moves forward.

To make a `CHECK`, you assemble a pool of six sided dice to try to beat an opposed pool assembled by the GM.

First, you need to agree with the GM on which of the `12 ACTIONS` is being used.

Once that is done, the GM prepares a `RISK POOL` while the player prepares their `ACTION POOL`.

### Gm’S Risk Pool

To build a `RISK POOL`, the GM looks at the fiction and evaluates the risk tied to the action and runs their decision with the rest of the group to make sure everyone agrees.

- For a risky action, use 1d6.
- For a desperate action, use 2d6.
- For a hopeless action, use 3d6.

### Player's Action Pool

The `ACTION POOL` represents the effort of the PC to overcome a task.

- You start with `1d6`.
- If your character is `SKILLED` in the chosen `ACTION`, add `+1d6`.
- You can also `FILL YOUR HEART WITH HOPE`. Spend `1 HOPE` for an additional `+1d6`.

### Assist

If you want to `ASSIST` a fellow PC, describe how you do it and give `+1 IMPACT` or `-1 COST` to their final result.
By doing this, you also expose yourself to the possible `CONSEQUENCES` that results of their action.

### Interpreting The Result

When everyone is ready, roll the dice and compare the single highest result of your `ACTION POOL` against the result of the GM’s `RISK POOL`.

- If your result is higher, you get a `PAYOFF` and `+1 HOPE` if you didn't spend any for this action.
- On a tie, you get a `PAYOFF` for your action, but there's a `CONSEQUENCE`.
- If your result is lower, your action didn't work and there's a `CONSEQUENCE`.

### Which Risk To Pick

By default, if a player is making an `CHECK`, the situation is risky. In some occasions, you can use a desperate pool but doing it often or going higher than that will make the odds heavily against the players

When in doubt, look at the fiction, but keep this in mind when building your `RISK POOL`.

## Payoffs & Consequences

After a `CHECK`, we use the number of dice from each pool as a rating to determine the outcome of the action.

The size of your `ACTION POOL` is called the `{IMPACT}`, and is used to determine the effect of a successful action.

The size of the `RISK POOL` is called the `{COST}`, and is used to determine the strength of a consequence prompted by an action.

### Payoffs

When you get a `PAYOFF`, you get what you want. The player chooses one from the following list:

- For a simple `CHECK`, you get what you want.
- If there's a `CHALLENGE TRACK` in play, mark boxes matching the `{IMPACT}`.
- If the fiction allows it, reduce tension of a future action. Remove `-1d6` to the `RISK POOL` for one upcoming `CHECK`.
-

### Consequences

When there’s a `CONSEQUENCE`, something bad happens. The GM chooses one from the following list:

- Introduce something new and dangerous in the fiction.
- If there's a `DANGER TRACK` in play, mark boxes matching the `{COST}`.
- Inflict `HARM` matching the `{COST}`.
- If the fiction allows it, increase tension of a future action. Add `+1d6` to the `RISK POOL` for one upcoming `CHECK`.

### Zero Cost & Reduced Consequences

Some of the game’s mechanics affect the `{IMPACT}` and the `{COST}` of a roll either positively or negatively. Which means there will be occasions where an action can have a `{COST}` of zero. When that happens, look at the fiction and use a `REDUCED CONSEQUENCE`.

For example, if you were thinking about marking HARM, look into marking a `DANGER TRACK` instead. If you were planning to mark a `DANGER TRACK` already, introduce new threats in the fiction.

Go with what feels right according to what has already been established.

## Non-Player Character

In this game, NPCs don't roll for their actions. NPCs succeed unless the players attempt to stop them, in which case the action roll does double-duty: it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved.

The result tells us about the impact and the cost of an action at the same time, encouraging players to be active participants in the story.

## Balancing Tracks

`TRACKS` are the core pacing mechanism in the game and understanding how their boxes are marked is crucial in understanding how to balance the challenges and treats in a session.

Players will generally want to make `CHECKS` when they are `SKILLED`. That means that the `{IMPACT}` of their roll will often be between 2 or 3.

On the other end, the GM will often have a `RISK POOL` with a `{COST}` of 1, sometimes 2 and rarely 3.

This discrepancy in favor of the player in there for statistical reasons. Though it means that the size of `CHALLENGE TRACKS` and `DANGER TRACKS` should be adjusted accordingly.

Making a `DANGER TRACK` with 8 segments will take a very long time to fill, while a CHALLENGE TRACK with only 3 segments will quickly be resolved by the players.

Generally speaking, to keep things relatively balanced, `DANGER TRACK`S should have between 3, 5 or 8 boxes.

For `CHALLENGE TRACKS`, you can easily go up to 5, 8 or even 13 boxes.

This is simply a guideline so you can consider this a good starting point when using `TRACKS`.
