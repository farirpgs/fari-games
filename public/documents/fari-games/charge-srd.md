# Introductions | Charge SRD

The Charge SRD is a condensed version of the rules of Charge RPG that you can use to make your own **Powered by Charge** games.

It follows a certain format that you can use as a base framework for your game, but also offers design advice so that you can hack it while still keeping the "Charge feeling"

You can fill-in the gaps, or tear-it down to make something completely different.

We can't wait to see what you will build with this. Enjoy!

# The Game | Charge SRD

In this game, you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional characters facing, and trying to overcome obstacles. You decide how the characters resolve those challenges, and how the world reacts to those actions.

## What You Need To Play

Here’s what you’ll need to play:

- Between two and five people. One of them acting as the Game Master.
- Character sheets, one for each player.
- A bunch of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- Index cards, sticky notes or similar slips of paper.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or `NPCs`.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or `PCs`.

While the GM is usually the main person in charge of the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful, and captivating.

## Game Structure

To play this game, you meet-up with other people either in real life or online to collaborate on creating an interesting story together.

Each `session` is its own unique experience and is made of multiple `scenes` stitched together, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what their characters do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of dice rolls.

We roll dice because we want to be on the edge of our seats. We want to be surprised by where the story takes us next.

## Safety Tools

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important, and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

# Character Creation | Charge SRD

## Details

Characters are defined by descriptive traits called `details`. Each character usually has between 2-5 of them to highlight who they are, and what is important about them. Those details aren’t just information to give the character color, but should be the aspects of the character that we pay attention to in the story. They are also used as a guide to know the different narrative liberties that a character has in the fiction.

When creating a new character, write down their:

- `Concept`: an elevator-pitch version of who the character is.
- `Appearance`: what the character looks like, what they wear, etc.
- `Ties`: 1-3 relations that the character has with certain people or organizations in the world.

> #### Designer Note: Hacking the Details
>
> An easy way to customize Charge is by changing the default `details` of the characters.
> They are a simple yet effective way to reinforce what is narratively important in your setting.
>
> Are the PCs parts of noble houses ? Or are they magically imbued with certain types of powers ?
> Define `details` around those concepts to support important aspects of the game.
>
> You can aim to have around `2-5 details`.

## Actions

When a PC needs to overcome an obstacle and there is a risk, they use one of their `actions`.

At character creation, assign `7 action dots` among the following action list:

- `Muscle`: you use your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
- `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
- `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
- `Sneak`: you traverse skillfully and quietly.
- `Shoot`: you carefully track and shoot at a target.
- `Tinker`: you understand, create, or repair complex mechanisms or organisms.
- `Study`: you gather, scrutinize and analyze information.
- `Notice`: you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.
- `Bond`: you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.
- `Command`: you compel swift obedience with skills and respect.
- `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
- `Sway`: you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

At the start of the game, a single action cannot have more than `2 action dots`.

> #### Designer Note: Hacking the Actions
>
> Words are important so you should look at changing the default action list to better fits your game's aesthetic.
>
> First, look at what you think characters will do the most in your game. Are they going to fight a lot or are they going to play a political game ? Depending on what you are aiming for, adapt the action list to reflect your intentions.
>
> If you use less than 12 actions, you might want to look at reducing the initial action dots PCs get at the start of a the game. A good ratio is something like `{number of actions} / 2 + 1`.
>
> Here are a couple of generic examples you can use as is or as an inspiration for your game:
>
> ---
>
> Assign `4 action dots` in:
>
> - `Muscle`: you your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
> - `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
> - `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
> - `Study`: you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
> - `Talk`: you reassure, socialize or influence with kindness, guile, charm or argument.
> - `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
>
> ---
>
> Assign `3 action dots` in:
>
> - `Strength` / `Agility` / `Intelligence` / `Charm`
>
> ---
>
> Assign `2 action dots` in:
>
> - `Power` / `Speed` / `Focus`
>
> ---
>
> _...etc_

## Talents

Talents are specific abilities your character gains when they reach certain milestones in the story.

A `talent` either gives them new a `action dot` to invest, or a new `situational talent` which give them a temporary boost in specific circumstances.

At the start of the game, characters begin with zero talents. They will gain those special abilities when they achieve certain milestones in the story.

> #### Designer Note: Hacking Talents
>
>
> The default character sheet in Charge has a `talent tree` containing 13 `talents`. That being said, we don't necessarily think you should do the same for you game.
>
> Taking into consideration that Charge is generic by default, we wanted to offer more leeway for the group to make their characters progress at their own pace. That's the reason the `talent tree` is that big.
>
> Since the average campaign lasts for around 6 sessions, having a `talent tree` with 4 or even 6 `talents` should be more than enough.


> #### Designer Note: Making Playbooks
>
> Playbooks are character sheet presets that often represent a certain archetype. They are partially filled to make character creation smoother for the players. 
> 
> Limiting choices is often a good way to kickstart creativity, and that's exactly what happens with a game that uses playbooks. They are also a great way to introduce the group to the kind of characters the story is going to be focused on.
>
> To make a playbook in Charge, you first need to find a cool name. Look for something catchy that will be easy to remember, and fits the theme of the game. Once you've found one, write it down as the `concept` of that playbook.
> 
> For the other `details` of the character, offer multiple options for the players to choose from. For example, a list of possible `ties` or relations the characters might have.
> 
> For the `actions`, assign 3 starting `action dots` in you think this playbook is skilled at. The remaining 4 are left for the player to assign. If you decided to use increase or reduce the default number of actions, you should adjust those numbers accordingly.
>
> The last thing you need to make a playbook is to define its `talent tree`. Each playbook can have between 4 or 6 distinct `talents` which makes playing this playbook a fun, and unique experience. 
> 
> A good way to get started with this is to think about what makes the playbook you are designing special. Think about its powers, abilities or the cool gear they might be using. 
> 
> Give each `talent` a name and describe what they do. A talent can do many things including, but not limited to:
> 
> - `+1d6 when ______`
> - `+1 position when ______`
> - `+1 effect when ______`
> - `Use [action] instead of [action] when ______`
> - `[New narrative liberty] when ______`


# Mechanics | Charge SRD

In this game the GM and the players tell a story, and afterwards look at the rules to see if something needs to be resolved using the game's mechanics. You don't look at the rules first, you look at the fiction first.

See those mechanics as tools in a box to use as needed. They exist to resolve situations where you don't know the direct answers to a question.

## Rolling Dice

The game uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it's a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it's a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that's a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there is a `consequence`.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it's a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You don't achieve your goal, and suffer a `consequence`.

_If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a critical when you have zero dice._

Most of the game's mechanics revolve around this basic format.

## Action Rolls

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, and there's a risk of failure, a player makes an `action roll`.

The number of dice to roll depends on the `action` the character is doing. The list of possible action can be found in the character creation section.

In this game, NPCs don't roll for their actions. NPCs succeed unless the players attempt to stop them, in which case the action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**. The action roll tells us the results, and the consequences of an action at the same time, encouraging players to be active participants in the story.

To make an action roll, we go through the following steps:

#### 1. Player Sets Their Goal

The player states their goal and, which `action` they are using.

#### 2. GM Sets the Position

The GM sets the position of the situation based on what has been established in the narrative.

- In a `controlled` position, the risk is limited. Even if things go wrong, there is a way out.
- In a `risky` position, the situation is dangerous. If you fail, there will be repercussions.
- In a `desperate` position, the odds are against you. Attempting to go against them might backfire heavily.

By default, an action roll is `risky`. You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved.

#### 3. GM Sets the Effect Rating

The GM sets the effect rating of the action.

- With a `great` effect, you achieve more than usual.
- With a `standard` effect, you achieve what we would have expected.
- With a `limited` effect, you achieve a partial or weak effect.

#### 4. Player Evens the Odds

As the player, you decides if you want to even the odds by adding bonus dice to your pool.

You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll.

For one bonus die, you can get assistance from a teammate. They consume `1 momentum`, say how they help you, and give you `+1d6`.

For another bonus die, you can either:

- `Push yourself`: Consume `2 momentum` to get `+1d6` or an improved `effect` rating.
- `Add tension` to the scene, to get `+1d6`.

#### 5. Roll the Dice

Finally, the player rolls the dice, and the group judges the result.

- On a `66` it's a critical success. You achieve your goal with increased `effect`.
- On a `6` it's a full success. You achieve your goal.
- On a `4-5` it's a partial success. You achieve your goal, but there's a `consequence`.
- On a `1-3` it's a bad outcome. Things go badly, and there's a `consequence`.

If the result of the dice is higher than `3`, the PC gains `momentum` from their action except if they pushed themselves.

## Momentum

When a player makes an action roll, that roll has a chance generating `momentum`.

You start every session with `2`, and generate more `momentum` when making successful action rolls.

- On a `4-5`, you gain `+1 momentum`.
- On a `6`, you gain `+2 momentum`.
- On a `66`, you gain `+3 momentum`.

PCs consume their `momentum` to boost their actions, assist an ally or resist a `consequence`.

**When momentum is spent for a roll, that roll cannot in turn generate momentum.**

> #### Designer Note: Momentum Dial
>
> If you want your game to feel grimmer or bigger than life, a simple way to do this is by changing **when momentum is gained** and **how much is gained**. This is called changing the `momentum dial`.
>
> Changing this dial is an easy way to change the whole vibe of a game. Since `pushing yourself` and making `determination rolls` to resist consequences rely on `momentum` only, the `momentum dial` has a big impact on the game.
>
> If you turn up the `momentum dial`, PCs will be able to boost their rolls more often and will have an easier time resisting consequences. Turn it down, and PCs will instead need to rely more on their initial `action dots` to make their action roll. Consequences on the other end will hit way harder with a dial turned down.
>
> Tune it and test this until it feels right for your game. One thing to keep in consideration is that by default `momentum` is gained for participating in the game. We do this to make the players more interested in taking risks. Your game should try to do the same to keep that "Charge" feeling.

## Boosting Action Rolls

If you want, you can add bonus dice to your action roll by using **one** of the following methods.

### Push Yourself

When you `push yourself`, you consume `2 momentum` **per push** to gain one of the following bonuses.

- Add `+1d6` to your dice pool.
- Gain `+1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action even if you were taken out.

### Add Tension

When you `add tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension look like here?"_. The GM then offers a `consequence`, like ticking segments on a danger clock, inflicting stress on your character, or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the `consequence`, add `+1d6` to your current dice pool.

There could be scenarios where adding tension isn't an option. In that case, the GM can simply communicate that to the player so that they look into other ways to even the odds.

## Team work

The PCs can help one another in different ways to assure that the teams overcome the different challenges that are facing them.

### Assist

When you `assist` a PC, you consume `1 momentum`, to give `+1d6` to their roll. When doing this, you also expose yourself to possible danger.

### Protect

When you protect a PC, you step in to confront a consequence they would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene, and suffer the consequence for them.

You can make a `determination roll` to try to reduce or cancel the consequence.

### Set up

When you perform a setup action, you make an `action roll` to have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets `+1 effect` level or `improved position` for their roll.

You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

## Consequences

If you make an action roll and you get a `partial success (4-5)` or a `bad outcome (1-3)`, you suffer a `consequence`.

The GM chooses one of the following:

- `Reduced Effect` : reduce the `effect` of the action by one level.
- `Complication`: tick one segment per `consequence rating` on a new or existing `danger clock`.
- `Worse Position` : reduce the `position` of the PC by one level for their next action rolls.
- `Lost Opportunity` : what you tried didn't work, you need to use another `action`.
- `Worse Condition`: take `1 stress` per `consequence rating`.

The `consequence rating` is determined by looking at the position for the roll.

- A `controlled` position, has a consequence rating of `1`.
- A `risky` position, has a consequence rating of `2`.
- A `desperate` position, has a consequence rating of `3`.

## Determination Roll

If a character suffers a `consequence` that you, as a player, don't like, you can try to resist it.

You do so by calling for a `determination roll` to see how well you resist the consequence.

Build a pool of d6s by adding `+1d6` for each charge of momentum you are willing to consume for the roll.

Once you've decided how many charges you want to consume, roll and interpret the results:

- On a `1-3`, the `consequence` still happens.
- On a `4-5`, the `consequence` is reduced.
- On a `6`, the `consequence` is avoided.
- On a `66`, the `consequence` is avoided, and you get +1 position for your next roll.

## Clocks

Clocks are circles divided in either 4, 6 or 8 segments used to track a task's **progress** or escalating **danger** in a scene. They can also be used on a PC's character sheet to track the long term `projects` that they are working on or the `complications` that they create in the world.

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments the clock should have.

When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can use a `progress clock` and:

- Tick 1 segment for a `limited effect`.
- Tick 2 segments for a `standard effect`.
- Tick 3 segments for a `great effect`.

When a PC gets a consequence from an action roll, you can use `danger clock` and:

- Tick 3 segments for a `desperate position`.
- Tick 2 segments for a `risky position`.
- Tick 1 segment for a `controlled position`.

When a clock is filled, a narrative element in the story is now resolved. Either the PCs got closer to their goal, or danger has come to fruition and makes the situation more complicated.

## Health and Condition

When a PC gets hurt as a result of a consequence, they take `stress`. Each stress ticks a segment on the PC's `stress clock ⨁`.

As the stress clock gets filled, you also need to update the PC's `condition` by writing a small descriptive text below the clock.

The character's condition imposes narrative restrictions as to what the character can or cannot do.

When the 4 segments of the `stress clock` are filled, the PC is taken out for the scene, and their stress clock is cleared. Because they were taken out, the next scenes should handle how the character's recovery is going to happen in the fiction.

## Recovery

As time passes, PCs will get better, and their condition will improve.

If the fiction allows it, once per session clear 1 segment off a PC's `stress clock`. Also update the condition text to represent the character's current `condition`.

## Progression

As the story progresses over time, so will the characters.
So at the end of every session, you can update a character's `details` to represent how they've grow over the course of the session.

When a big event is concluded in the story, the GM can decide to award the group a new `talent dot`. This is called reaching a `milestone`.

Players invest those talent dots in their respective `talent tree` to make their characters stronger and more versatile.

A talent either gives the PC a new `action dot`, or a `situational talent`.

A situational talent gives a bonus or a certain narrative liberty during a certain situation.

- `+1d6 when ______`
- `+1 position when ______`
- `+1 effect when ______`
- `Use [action] instead of [action] when ______`
- `[New narrative liberty] when ______`

> #### Designer Note: Hacking Progression
>
> The longer it takes for a `milestone` to happen, the longer it will take for characters to become stronger.
>
> This is important to keep in mind depending on what kind of progression curve you want to have.
>
> Do you want to have a short campaign where characters will grow stronger pretty quickly, or are you looking for a year-spanning one where the characters will mostly evolve by changing their character `details` and where milestones will be more scarce?
>
> You could go as low as giving the player character only 2-3 Talents during an entire campaign, or reward them more often.
>
> There isn't a right or wrong answer here. It depends 100% on what kind of game you want to have.

## Fortune Rolls

When the outcome of a situation isn't certain, and the players aren't involved, the GM makes a `fortune roll` to see what happens.

Add `+1d6` per likeliness level of that thing happening.

- On a **critical success**, great results, and something exceptional happens.
- On a **full success**, great results.
- On a **partial success**, mixed results.
- On a **bad outcome**, bad results.

## Flashbacks

Players can call for a `flashback` scene if they want to declare that their character tried to prepare for a certain situation before it happened.

Flashback scenes aren't like time travel, and can't undo what was already established in the narrative.

When a player calls for a flashback scene:

- The GM sets a cost in `momentum` between `0-2` for the scene.
- Depending on the fiction, either
  - the player gets what they want.
  - the GM makes a fortune roll to see what happens.
  - the player makes an action roll to see what happens.

> You can see the full list of extras [here](/en/srds/fari-games/charge-rpg/what-are-extras) but this SRD contains a couple of pre-condensed extras that you can use as is.

# World Extra | Extras

During sessions, the PCs will go on missions to accomplish objectives. They will then come back to their H.Q. to debrief, rest and recover.

At the start of the game, or **every time the PCs come back to their H.Q.**, the GM draws **3 `hook cards`** of a standard deck of playing cards.

- The first card tells us about something related to [Theme #1].
- The second card tells us about something related to [Theme #2].
- The third tells the GM what the PC's next mission is going to be.

The GM can use those hooks to create narrative threads for the PCs to explore and bring life to the world.

> #### Designer Note

Once the 3 cards are drawn, the GM uses the prompts on the first two to explain what happened while the PCs were away. The PCs can then spend time exploring those threads as they see fit.

When the PCs are ready for their next mission, the GM makes a `mission roll`.

To do so, the GM looks at the 3 cards they've drawn, and builds a dice pool of `1d6` for each red card (<span style="color:red">♥ ♦</span>).

If there's no red card, roll `2d6`, and select the lowest number.

The result of this roll tells us what is going to be the initial `position` the PCs will find themselves in when starting their next mission.

- On a `1-3`, the PCs start in a `desperate` position.
- On a `4-5`, the PCs start in a `risky` position.
- On a `6`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position.
- On a `66`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position, and gain some additional benefit.

The GM introduces the mission to the PCs, and they decide how they will approach the situation.

Once they've decided on a strategy, the GM cuts to the first scene of the mission using the result of the mission roll to describe the PCs current position.

Once the mission is over, the PCs go back to their H.Q., and the loop starts anew.

# World Forces | Charge SRD

> #### Designer Note: Making World Forces
>
> Charge games usually have what we call `world forces`.
>
> A `force` is something or someone with goals looking to change the status quo in significant and narratively interesting ways.
>
> This could be a person, but it could also be an organization, a country, a planet, mother nature, or the space-time continuum!
>
> For each force you create, define what their `goal` is. Their goal defines the impact the force will have on the world. A goal isn't necessarily good or bad— it is merely what the force wants to accomplish. It can also be considered to be "good" by the Force itself, but others might have different view on the subject.
>
> Lastly, define 2-3 `methods` the force is going to use to interact with the world in the hope of achieving their goal
>
> Here's an example of what a world force could look like:
>
> #### Force Example
>
> **The Rebel Forces** want to **get rid of the usurper that sits on the throne by:**
>
> - _Finding dirt on the government to expose corruption._
> - _Convincing the real king to take back what is theirs._
> - _Finding money to hire mercenaries to fight an eventual war._
>
> Designing world forces is an efficient and simple way to fill the world with interesting factions that the players will be able to interact with.

# Attachment Extra | Extras

If you want to resist a `consequence`, but don’t want to make a `determination roll`, you can decide to break one of your `attachment`. Doing so cancels the consequence outright.

However, this can only be done when it makes sense narratively, and that particular mod cannot be used until time is taken to repair or reacquire it.

To re-require or repair a MOD, the PC needs to start a `project progress clock` and track it on their character sheet. The clock starts at 4 segments, but may have more segments if the mod is complicated to repair, if it was heavily damaged, or if it is difficult to reacquire.

To make progress on the project, a character may only roll to repair a "broken" attachment when they have the appropriate amount of downtime.

Once the project is completed, the character is permitted to use the attachment in the fiction, and is allowed to block a new consequence by breaking it once again.
