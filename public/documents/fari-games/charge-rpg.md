## Who Is This Game For ?

Now, one of the first things you probably want to know is: **who is this game for?**

> _This game is for people who want to play a generic, narrative table-top RPG adventure about a group of characters struggling to achieve their goals, but pushing themselves to succeed._

## Contributing

One of the core parts of what makes this game unique is that it **belongs to the community**.

The game is free, released under an open game license, and welcomes contributions.

Some systems encourage game designers to develop their own games using their rules. Charge, on the other hand, encourages game designers to help make it grow.

What we mean by that is that you can:

- Suggest core rules updates
- Provide new Extras
- Help improve the quality and reachability of the game by proofreading or translating it etc.

If you contribute to this project in any way, your name will be added in the [credits](/en/srds/fari-games/charge-rpg/credits) of the game. If you designed a specific extra for the game, your name will also be credited there.

While Charge accepts donations, those donations will be re-invested in the game directly by commissioning the creation of official art, paying for the editing, etc.

If you want to contribute to Charge, join [Fari's Discord server](https://fari.app/discord) or check-out the [Charge Community Forums](https://farigames.itch.io/charge-rpg/community) on Itch.

# Goals | Power Your Storytelling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/4e66d10b4b1784cc27093097134aaa35.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-sun-sea-dragon-flying-4033001/)

There are thousands of great table-top role-playing games out there. Some are generic, like Charge, and others are made with a very specific setting in mind. In the latter, mechanics are often created to reinforce the setting.

Charge is generic, which means you get to pick the world and setting you want to play in. You could play in a Sci-Fi setting where new planets are still being discovered and terraformed every year, or on Earth during the British Industrial Revolution. You get to choose.

Because settings can differ greatly, Charge's game mechanics were made with very specific goals in mind to help you create the story you want to tell.

## The Idea Behind Charge

Here are some things that makes Charge special compared to other games you might have played before.

> **It's easy to create characters for any settings.**
>
> ---
>
> Characters are easy to define, and still unique in their own way. Charge gives you a good framework to create characters for settings you want.
>
> Charge does this by making characters shine using `character details` to define who they are and how they're linked to the world. They have `actions` to highlight what they are good at, and `talents` to make them evolve in interesting ways.

> **It offers easy to tune dials and extras to have "grimmer" up to "bigger than life" adventures.**
>
> ---
>
> From a post-apocalyptic survival adventure where each bullet counts, to a grand space opera where the heroes always prevail, the mechanics are easily tuneable to reflect the kind of story you want to tell.
>
> Either adjust the main difficulty setting of the game, or use one of the many `extras` provided to play the way you want to.

> **It is both a utility belt, and a toolbox.**
>
> ---
>
> Charge is a toolbox, because it has a set of mechanics to resolve narrative problems in multiple different ways. It is also a utility belt, since it gives you a default way to play that's easy to pick-up and use.
>
> Play it as is, or hack it as your want.

You will like this game if:

- you like narrative-focused systems
- you like that you can play in any setting
- you generally think that failure is more interesting than success
- you like when your character starts competent and gradually becomes more flexible
- you like playing Fate or Forged in the Dark games

Charge also brings new interesting ideas to the table, like a flexible progression framework and mechanics to make players want to interact with the world instead of staying still on the back-seat waiting for the best moment to act.

We hope you have fun with this, because we sure had fun writing it and playing it.

Now, let's go over what you need to play Charge.

# What You Need To Play | Power Your Storytelling

To play Charge, you need:

- Copies of the [Charge RPG Character Sheet](/documents/fari-games/charge-rpg/downloads/character-sheet.pdf)
- A pile of index cards or small pieces of paper to draw things on.
- A set of six-sided dice. At least 6 would be ideal.
- A bunch of awesome people to play with. Usually 2 to 5 people should do the trick. More than that could prove to be difficult.

# The Game | Power Your Storytelling

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cbb1bac26449de5d6762c699efe5585.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/spaceship-ufo-rock-mountains-5848274/)

Charge is a generic table-top role-playing game. That means that you and your friends get together to tell an interactive story about a group of fictional characters you create. Those characters face obstacles and challenges, and you get to decide how they react. The world then changes based on what the characters do.

## Game Master & Players

One person in the group needs to act as the `Game Master`, or `GM`. The GM is responsible for the world and the characters that live in it (those that aren't directly played by the rest of the table). We call those characters "non-player characters", or *NPC*s.

The rest of the group are `Players`. The players create a character that experiences compelling stories inside this world. We call those player characters, or *PC*s.

While the GM is usually the main person responsible for the way the world changes over time, everyone at the table is in charge of the story.

This isn't a "GM versus Players" or "GM is god" kind of deal. If playing this game was like making a movie, the **GM would be the director** and all the **players would be writers**.

Everyone at the table contributes to make the story successful and captivating.

## Game Structure

Everything inside Charge is collaborative.

You choose a setting together, you create your characters together, and you make that world evolve together.

Each session is made of `scenes`, like in a movie. Each scene plays out as a bunch of back-and-forth between the GM and the players. The GM describes what the scene is like, the players tell the GM what they do, and the GM makes the world react to those actions depending on the outcomes of certain dice rolls.

Each time you and your friends meet to play Charge is a `session` which can last between 1 and 4 hours, or even more. The amount of time each session takes depends on a lot of factors.

Each group can play very differently. Some might take their time while others might rush into things head-on, but it also depends on everyone's availability.

During sessions, tension rises during scenes, and the players encounter narrative unknowns. To decide what happens during those moments, the group rolls dice because they want to be on the edge of their seats. They want to be surprised by where the story takes them next.

Before we look at how to create the players' characters, we need to talk about making a safe environment for everyone at the table.

# Safety at the Table | Power Your Storytelling

## Safety Tools

If at any point during the game creation process, or when playing a scene, something doesn't click with someone at the table, the game needs to be paused and things need to be aligned and discussed so that **everyone is on the same page**.

One way the GM can help make the table safer for everyone is by using safety tools like the [**X-Card**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit) by John Stavropoulos, or Beau's [**Script Change RPG Toolbox**](https://briebeau.itch.io/script-change).

This is super important and should not be taken lightly. Everyone at the table should feel safe and comfortable.

If you don't feel safe at a table, it is totally OK to quit and find another group of people to play with. Don't feel bad, and more importantly, respect yourself.

## RPG Etiquette

Remember to be empathetic of people's schedules and responsibilities. Some people have kids, pets, jobs, and other things that make scheduling sessions very hard. Show up on time and take the amount of gameplay time that you can get.

Then, patiently wait until the next session. And while you are waiting, remember and praise the awesome moments that happened in the last session.

# Creating your Character | Character Creation

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/6c402c4fb66bc6ac29d20b7bee048d9a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/landscape-fantastic-surreal-mood-6543972/)

As a player, you create a `character`.

Your character is defined by certain traits, and tied to certain elements of the world they live in. They will affect the world around them with their `actions`. If their actions are not completely successful they will lead to `consequences` which might inflict `stress` or worsen their `condition`.

The `details` of your characters are a good way to make your characters unique in the fiction, but Charge uses `talents` to give characters mechanical benefits when doing an `action roll`.

You can find each of those terms in the character sheet, but let's go over what all of them mean and how we use them during a session.

## Details

Characters are defined by descriptive traits called `details`. Each character usually has between 2-5 of them to highlight who they are, and what is important about them. Those details aren’t just information to give the character color, but should be the aspects of the character that we pay attention to in the story. They are also used as a guide to know the different narrative liberties that a character has in the fiction.

![](https://gyazo.com/e4ac2539a73b8650b7aee2ca20661371.png)

### Concept

The `concept` of your character is like the elevator-pitch version of who they are.

On your character sheet, write a small sentence that quickly sums them up.

A good concept could include things like:

- their profession or role within the group
- where they come from
- a personality trait
- a unique talent they possess etc.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Appearance

Next is your character's `appearance`.

Use this section to describe what your character looks like. You can talk about their shape, size, what they wear, etc.

This will help everyone at the table when they need to picture your character as they are interacting with them.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Ties

Since your character is one of the story's protagonists, they need to be linked to the different forces in the world. They weren't born yesterday (or were they?), so they have probably made friends or foes with different people or organizations.

To establish those links, we define `ties`.

A tie links your character to another player's character, an organization, or other [world forces](making-a-compelling-campaign).

When you write down a tie for your character, try to answer **who is my character linked to** and also **how they are linked to them**.

This will also help establish a bit of a general backstory for your character, without you having to write down 10 pages of notes that might end up staying unused.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

> #### Choosing Details in Play
>
> You don't need to entirely flesh out your character before you start playing.
>
> Simply choosing your `concept` is more than enough to get going.
>
> After the first session or two, you will have a better idea of who your character is, so finding those details later is totally fine.
>
> But if you want some help in fleshing out your characters, you can always use the free [Fari Story Builder](https://fari.app/story-builder) to get the inspiration flowing!
> ![](https://gyazo.com/5b5e8bf5924e020ea2bc0926103a20f2.gif)

## Actions

If a player character wants to do something challenging or that could potentially fail, they make an **action roll.**

Failure is possible if there is some sort of obstacle to overcome, like something that's in your way or somebody looking to stop you.

That being said, not every interaction with the world requires a roll. If the character does something we'd expect them to simply accomplish, then you don't roll anything. They simply do it.

In Charge, there are **12 actions** characters can do.

When creating a character, you need to **distribute 7 action dots** among those 12 actions. At the start of a campaign, a single action cannot have more than 2 action dots.

Those dots represent how good your character is at doing things. As the game progresses, you will gain additional dots that make your character more flexible. See [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](mechanics#progression).

The 12 actions are grouped into 3 categories called `Attributes`. There is `Physique`, `Insight` and `Resolve`.
For now let's look at the 12 different types of actions.

### The 12 Actions

![12 Actions](https://gyazo.com/70ccecc40690c43a0948cd05db0c0d80.png)

#### Physique

When you `Muscle`, you use your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.

> You might lift, punch, grapple, hack and slash. You might wrestle with a wild animal. You might blast a door open. You could try to fight in a formal duel (but `Finesse` might be better).

When you `Finesse`, you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.

> You might steal something from someone's pocket. You might hack a security system. You might helm the controls of a ship. You could try to pick a lock (but `Tinker` might be better).

When you `Move`, you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.

> You might climb, swim, run, or jump. You might outpace the guards. You might jump above a spiked pit. You could try to lose someone on your tail (but `Sneak` might be better).

When you `Sneak`, you traverse skillfully and quietly.

> You might sneak past a guard or hide in the shadows. You could try to back-stab a solder in the middle of a battle (but `Muscle` might be better).

#### Insight

When you `Shoot`, you carefully track and shoot at a target.

> You might snipe an enemy long-distance. You might throw a fireball to light the battlefield on fire. You might aim the ship's laser guns. You could try to skill-fully throw a dart in a bar game (but `Finesse` might be better).

When you `Tinker`, you understand, create, or repair complex mechanisms or organisms.

> You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might mend a broken bone. You could try to use your technical expertise to control a vehicle (but `Finesse` might be better).

When you `Study`, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.

> You might gather information from documents, newspapers, and books. You might closely analyze a person to detect lies or true feelings. You could try to examine events to understand a pressing situation (but `Notice` might be better).

When you `Notice`, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.

> You might pick up important details in the moment. You might anticipate danger before it happens. You could try to figure out what is making someone sick (but `Study` might be better).

#### Resolve

When you `Bond`, you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.

> You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm, style, or empathy. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but `Sway` might be better).

When you `Command`, you compel swift obedience with skills and respect.

> You might intimidate or threaten to get what you want. You might ask a small militia to get their things together. You might order your undead minions to sacrifice themselves for you. You could also ask your familiar to look for something in a room (but `Bond` might be better).

When you `Focus`, you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.

> You might meditate to enter the spirit world. You might concentrate to win a game of chess. You might enter a trance to finish up an important ritual. You could try to pay closer attention to your surroundings beyond what is visible (but `Notice` might be better).

When you `Sway`, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.

> You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but `Bond` or `Command` might be better).

### Which Action to Pick for a Roll

Some actions may overlap with others. This is by design. As your campaign progress, you group will also establish which action is the most effective in given situations.

Make this game your own.

As a player, you get to choose which action you roll by simply saying what your character does. Choosing one approach versus another might influence the position or effect of your action. The GM should tell you those details before you roll.

## Momentum

A character's `momentum` is a measure that represents the impact of your character on the world. The more you interact with the world, and the people that live in it, the more your character gains `charges of momentum`.

You start with 2 momentum at the beginning of each session and consume it to boost your action rolls or assist your teammates.

![](https://gyazo.com/e0aac9468c6a2a2932e59da933c64e21.png)

## Stress & Condition

When your character faces dangerous challenges and fails their `action roll`, something bad happens.

Maybe the situation is more complicated or even perilous. The alternative to this is that you get hurt. The GM is the one who decides if the `consequence` of the roll is harm or something else.

When you get hurt, you take a certain amount of `stress`, and each stress ticks a segment on your character's `stress clock`.

Each time your character takes stress, you need to update your character's `condition` and write down a short `detail` describing the state your character is in.

![Condition](https://gyazo.com/468a4a981adfbc795ef328b3b95e798a.png)

> ### A Word on Clocks
>
> Clocks are circles divided in 4, 6 or 8 segments used to track things that evolve over time during the game.
>
> They are used to track a character's condition, the different projects they are working on, the complications that they are creating around them, and even the obstacles that they are facing.
>
> Clocks will be covered later in [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Clocks**](mechanics#clocks)

When a character has a condition, their narrative liberties are restricted by said condition.

For example, it's almost impossible to climb on the roof of a house with a _twisted ankle_. So even if you have only **2 segments** ticked on your stress clock, your condition in and of itself still imposes narrative restrictions on what your character can do.

Here are a couple examples of conditions:

- When your stress clock has **1 or 2 segments** filled, you might be: exhausted, humiliated, tired, sore, winded, sick, etc.
- When your stress clock has **3 segments** filled, you might have a gunshot wound, a slash from a blade, a first degree burn, or be completely drunk.
- When your stress clock reaches **4 filled segments**, you clear it, and are taken out for the scene. You might have gotten a second degree burn, or a fractured leg, or your brain can't comprehend what is happening anymore.

## Talents

`Talents` are a way to make the characters progress over the course of a campaign.

Over time, characters gain new `talent dots` which make their `talent line` advance.

![](https://gyazo.com/6cab207e891b02249a7f96c66694010a.png)

Every dot in the talent line gives you either a new `action dot`, or a `situational bonus`.

A situational bonus represents a boost in `effect`, `position` or `dice pool`, and triggers only in a certain situation.

You don't need to worry about talents right now, especially if you just started your campaign.

When your campaign reaches a significant turning point, you can read [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Progression**](progression#milestones) to know how to make the characters feel more flexible.

## Projects and Complications

The `Projects and Complications` section of the character sheet is something the GM and players use to track long-term projects or ever-evolving dangers that span multiple sessions.

![](https://gyazo.com/cc0d601c9fc82fbfe8a433ac3fdc303d.png)

You don't need to know how to use this right away, so for more on this, check out [**Mechanics&nbsp;»&nbsp;Projects and Complications**](projects-and-complications).

## Character Recap

That covers the basic of how to create a character for Charge.

Now we will go over all the mechanics used in the game that exist to resolve unknown elements in the narrative.

# Fiction First | Mechanics

[![Image by Yuri_B from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/d6e7b317330d9dd554970cc75543ea7e.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/painting-knight-night-oil-paints-3995999/)

**Charge is a "fiction first" game.**

This means that the GM and the players tell a story, and afterwards look at the rules to see if something needs to be resolved using the game's mechanics.

You can see the mechanics in Charge as tools in a box, to use as needed. They resolve situations where you don't know the direct answers to a question.

> **_Will this character find what they are looking for? Can that character convince this merchant to talk? How will this faction react to this big event? etc._**

Sometimes, those situations are resolved with a mechanic that relies on the PCs' proficiencies, while other times they might be resolved with mechanics that straight-up relies on luck!

We do this to create a "wow" feeling in unknown situations. While the story is created by everyone at the table, the mechanics act as a guide that drives the narrative forward with unexpected outcomes.

Those mechanics mostly rely on figuring out what the risks are, and what is happening. Then a set of six-sided dice is rolled, results are interpreted, and the story moves on.

# Rolling Dice | Mechanics

The game uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it's a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it's a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that's a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there is a consequence.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it's a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You don't achieve your goal, and suffer a consequence.

> **_If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a critical when you have zero dice._**

Most of the game's mechanics revolve around this basic format.

# Action Roll | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/a2bbeb6748035e90162096c3e0a9680a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-landscape-architecture-3898554/)

**_I have a bad feeling about this..._**

You want to accomplish a goal, but something or someone is in your way. A person might be keeping information private that you desperately need, a locked door might block you from moving forward to save your friend, or a group of thugs intercepts you in an alley and wants revenge for something you've done to them in the past.

That's a challenge that needs to be overcome.

To see how it turns out, we make an `action roll` by going through the following steps:

## 1. Player Sets Their Goal

The first step in knowing whether or not your character overcomes the challenge is to know what they are doing and what is their goal.

Once the goal of your character has been established, the player decides which one of the **12 actions** they are going to use. Are they `Bonding` with a local merchant, or `Swaying` them into thinking that their prices are too high?

The action rating is used to define the initial dice pool of the roll.

> #### Active Opposition
>
> In Charge, NPCs don't roll for their actions. NPCs automatically succeed at their actions unless players attempt to intervene. In this case, an action roll does double-duty: **it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved**. This encourages players to get involved in the action and be proactive, rather than to sit back and be a passive participant.
>
> The action roll tells us the results, and the consequences of an action at the same time.
>
> On a `6`, the PC wins and gets what they wanted. On a `4 or 5`, both the PC and the NPC have an effect on the result. On a > `1-3`, the NPC wins and the outcome results in a consequence for the PC.

## 2. GM Sets the Position

The GM needs to set the `position` of the roll, based on the risks involved from failure. 

A situation is either in a `controlled`, `risky`, or `desperate` position.

- In a `controlled` position, the risk is limited. Even if things go wrong, there is a way out.
- In a `risky` position, the situation is dangerous. If you fail, there will be repercussions.
- In a `desperate` position, the odds are against you. Attempting to go against them might backfire heavily.

By default, if you roll to overcome something, you are probably in a `risky` position. You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved.

The GM uses the narrative context to determine which position to pick.

Another thing that might affect the position is the `action` being used. If a merchant you are trying to convince is in a bad mood, using `Sway` might be pretty `desperate`. `Bond` on the other hand could put you in a more `controlled` position.

The position helps determine what failure looks like.

## 3. GM Sets the Effect Rating

The position isn't the only thing that helps resolve the end result of a roll. Even in a desperate position, succeeding on a roll might still have a great `effect` on the narrative.

In Charge, there are 3 possible effect ratings: `great`, `standard`, and `limited`. In most common scenarios, if you are rolling to overcome something, you are probably looking at generating a `standard` effect. The GM is responsible for telling you this information.

If a heavy door is blocking your way, you could use `Finesse` to pick the lock. This might generate a `standard effect`, since it will take some time to do, but it's a more `controlled position`. You could also try to use `Tinker` and wreck the door open with an explosive. This may create a `great effect`, but might be a pretty `desperate` position, since it could create a lot of unwanted attention.

The effect rating helps determine what success looks like.

> #### The Fourth Effect Rating
>
> We said there were only 3 effect ratings, and that was actually a little bit of a lie since there's a fourth one called the `no-effect`.
>
> The GM can use this when a task is so difficult that whatever the PC attempts, there is no chance of success.
>
> Obviously, doing nothing is boring. That's why you can boost that `no-effect` to a `limited effect` if you Push Yourself using charges of momentum. More on that in [Even the Odds](#even-the-odds).

> #### The Impact of Effect & Position
>
> The `effect` and `position` help us understand what happens in the narrative, but they also have a mechanical impact on the game.
>
> To know what impact they have, numerical ratings are attached to them.
>
> | Position     | Effect     | Rating |
> | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
> | `Desperate`  | `Great`    | 3      |
> | `Risky`      | `Standard` | 2      |
> | `Controlled` | `Limited`  | 1      |
>
> When a roll succeeds, you use the `effect rating` to see how many segments you tick on progress clocks, how much information the character gets out of an investigation, etc.
>
> When a roll creates a consequence, you use the `position rating` to see how many segments you tick on danger clocks, how much stress a character gets when they are harmed, etc.
>

## 4. Player Evens the Odds

Even if the odds are stacked against them, your character still has aces up their sleeves.

The player can decide if they want to even the odds by adding bonus dice to their pool.

You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll.

For one bonus die, you can get assistance from a teammate. They consume `1 momentum`, say how they help you, and give you `+1d6`.

For another bonus die, you can use **one** of the following methods

### Push Yourself

When you `push yourself`, you consume `2 momentum` **per push** to gain one of the following bonuses.

- Add `+1d6` to your dice pool.
- Gain `+1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action even if you were taken out.

### Add Tension

When you `add tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension look like here?"_. The GM then offers a `consequence`, like ticking segments on a danger clock, inflicting stress on your character, or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the `consequence`, add `+1d6` to your current dice pool.

There could be scenarios where adding tension isn't an option. In that case, the GM can simply communicate that to the player so that they look into other ways to even the odds.

## Assist

When you `assist` a PC, you consume `1 momentum`, to give `+1d6` to their roll. When doing this, you also expose yourself to possible danger.

You can also even the odds by using **either** of the following methods.

> #### Use an Asset
>
> Assets are an optional rule available in [Extras&nbsp;»&nbsp;Asset Extra](asset-extra) which gives an additional way to even the odds. 

## Recap

So now, let's go over all of this again to recap what happens when you make an action roll.

> #### Action Roll
>
> 1. Pick an Action and find out how many dice you need to roll (the `action rating`)
> 1. Determine the `position` (`1 controlled` ► `2 risky` ► `3 desperate`)
> 1. Determine the `effect rating` (`3 great` ► `2 standard` ► `1 limited`)
> 1. Add `+1d6` if: you `push yourself` (`2 momentum`) -or- if you `add tension` to the scene.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `1 momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
> ---
>
> - On a `66 critical success`, you greatly overcome the obstacle
> - On a `6 full success`, you overcome the obstacle.
> - On a `4-5 partial success`, you overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.
> - On a `1-3 bad outcome`, you fail at overcoming the obstacle, and there's a `consequence`.

> #### Example
>
> _Xavier's character wants to take out a guard without him noticing anything. He decides to use **Sneak**. The GM looks at the situation and assesses that it's a **risky position** since the guard might not be alone, but the outcome would be of **great effect** because the guard isn't on high alert. Xavier doesn't want to leave everything up to chance, and decides to even the odds. He declares that his character will **push themselves** to get an additional `+1d6` by diving in the water to get closer before taking the guard out. Xavier rolls his dice pool and... gets a `5`, partial success! The GM then says that Xavier's character takes out the guard, but ticks 2 segments on an "Alert Clock" because of the noise Xavier's character made pulling the guard in the water._

# Consequences| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b40cf4934bebc8628bd3696c4e3b92c.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-city-castle-light-heaven-4382262/)

**_Sometimes things work out. Other times..._**

If you make an action roll and you get a `partial success (4-5)` or a `bad outcome (1-3)`, you suffer a `consequence`.

Consequences are a tool the GM can use to spice up the story. The GM uses the fiction, style, and tone established by the group to determine the type of consequence.

## Consequence Rating

When a consequence is inflicted on a player's character, the `position` of the action roll tells us how bad that consequence is.

So a consequence that comes from a `desperate` action roll is _usually_ worse than a consequence from a `controlled` one.

We call this the `consequence rating`. Some types of consequences use this rating directly to tie the consequence with some of the game's mechanics.

| Position     | Consequence Rating |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `Desperate`  | 3                  |
| `Risky`      | 2                  |
| `Controlled` | 1                  |

## Types of Consequences

Here are a couple of types of consequences that can be used in case of a bad roll:

### Reduced Effect

This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC's action isn't as effective as they'd anticipated.

> **Reduces the effect rating of the PC's action by one level.**
>
> ---
>
> _You hit them, but it's only a flesh wound. The security cameras are turned off, but the technicians are aware, and are looking to fix them as soon as possible._

### Complications

This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat.

> **Tick one segment per `consequence rating` on a new or existing `danger clock`.**
>
> ---
>
> _They heard you, and they are coming. You took too long, and you are almost out of air._

### Lost Opportunity

This represents shifting circumstance. What you tried didn't work, and now there's a new situation that prevents you from trying again. You need to find another approach.

> **Your latest attempt didn't work. If you want to try again, you need to use a different `action`.**
>
> ---
>
> _You were tailing someone, but they saw you and disappeared. You were fighting a robot, but they adapted, and are now able to anticipate your every move._

### Worse Position

This consequence represents losing control of the situation. The action carries you into a more dangerous `position`.

Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven't failed, but you haven't succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position.

This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from **controlled**, to **risky**, to **desperate** as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper into trouble.

> **Reduce the `position rating` by one level for future rolls related to that action.**
>
> ---
>
> _You missed your shot, now they know where you are. They initially trusted you, but now they have some doubts and will be watching you more closely._

### Worse Condition

This consequence represent injuries or trauma inflicted on a character.

When your condition worsens, you take a certain amount of `stress` that you track on your character's `stress clock`. You also need to update your `condition ` to represent the new state your character is in.

Your character's new condition will affect their narrative permissions, and how they can interact with the world.

When your stress clock is filled, you can clear all the segments, and your character is taken out for the scene.

> **Take `1 Stress` per `consequence rating` on your character's `condition`**
>
> ---
>
> _You laid down suppression fire, but got shot in the process. You've been running for hours to get to the place but now, you're sore and tired._

#### Negating Success

**Don't inflict a complication that negates a successful roll**.

If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a `4-5`, don't say that the enemy escapes. The player's roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered... maybe the PC has to wrestle them on the ground, and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.

<br/>

> #### I Have an Idea for a Consequence!
>
> If anyone at the table has an idea for a good consequence, hear them out!
>
> It can be daunting as a GM to always know what happens in case of failure. That is true especially if luck isn't on the player's side, and you need to find lots of different consequences in the same session.
>
> As the GM, don't hesitate to ask your players for ideas as well. Someone might have a fascinating suggestion, but they think it's not their place to speak up. Prove to them otherwise.

## Safety Reminder

Just a quick reminder that if you come up with a consequence during a session, and someone at the table isn't comfortable with it, think of something else.

Pause the game, and make sure everyone is OK with what is happening in the fiction. Once everyone is on the same page, unpause and move forward with a different consequence.

Even with safety mechanics in place, accidents happen. That is why you should always be flexible when you inflict a consequence to the group.

## Recap

> #### Consequences
>
> If the result of an action roll is between `1-5`, the GM inflicts **one** consequence:
>
> - **Reduced Effect** : reduce the `effect` of the action by one level.
> - **Complication**: tick one segment per `consequence rating` on a new or existing `danger clock`.
> - **Worse Position** : reduce the `position` of the PC by one level for their next action rolls.
> - **Lost Opportunity** : what you tried didn't work, you need to use another `action`.
> - **Worse Condition**: take `1 stress` per `consequence rating`.

# Determination Roll | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3c9ae5d526da51b44be1e7953077be51.png)](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/fantasy-battle-warrior-fire-falcon-3721894/)

**_Not on my watch! (you are filled with determination)_**

If a character suffers a `consequence` that you, as a player, don't like, you can try to resist it.

You do so by calling for a `determination roll` to see how well you resist the consequence.

You make that roll by burning momentum. Build a pool of d6s by adding `+1d6` per charge of momentum.

Once you've decided how many charges you want to consume, roll and interpret the results:

| Result | Name               | Explanation                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | The `consequence` still happens.                                          |
| `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | The `consequence` is reduced.                                             |
| `6`    | `Full Success`     | The `consequence` is avoided.                                             |
| `66`   | `Critical Success` | The `consequence` is avoided, and you get +1 position for your next roll. |

If you want, you can also resist a consequence that isn't targeting you directly . If you want to do so, see [**Team Work&nbsp;»&nbsp;Protect**](team-work#protect).

## Recap

> #### Determination Roll
>
> - Roll `+1d6` per consumed charges of momentum.
>   - On a `1-3`, The `consequence` still happens.
>   - On a `4-5`, The `consequence` is reduced.
>   - On a `6`, The `consequence` is avoided.
>   - On a `66`, The `consequence` is avoided, and you get +1 position for your next roll.

# Flashbacks | Mechanics

The rules don't distinguish between actions performed in the present moment and those performed in the past. When a scene is ongoing, you can invoke a `flashback` to roll for an action in the past that impacts your current situation. Maybe you went to a bar last night and befriended a couple of guards to make them drunk so that they call sick the next day. You then do a `flashback` scene, and make a `Bond` roll to see how that went.

The GM sets a cost in `momentum` for you to activate the flashback.

- `0 momentum`: An ordinary action for which you had easy opportunity.
- `1 momentum`: A complex action or unlikely opportunity.
- `2 (or more) momentum`: An elaborate action that involved special opportunities or contingencies.

After the momentum is consumed, a flashback action is handled just like any other action. Sometimes it will entail an action roll, because there's some danger or trouble involved.

Sometimes a flashback will entail a fortune roll, because we just need to find out how well (or how much, or how long, etc.). Sometimes a flashback won't call for a roll at all and just consuming the momentum will be enough.

When you are using flashbacks, you are focusing on the problems that _do_ happen, not the problems that _might_ happen.

## Limits of flashbacks

A flashback isn't time travel. It can't "undo" something that just occurred in the present moment. If the GM described something in the scene, it is now established in the fiction.

While you can't undo what has already happened, you can twist and adapt things that were left unsaid.

For instance, if a maître d' is making a scene to stop you from entering at a very high end restaurant, that's perhaps because you `Swayed` them into doing this the night before in exchange for money to make a diversion for the rest of the group.

## Recap

> #### Flashback
>
> Use this to handle the unpredictable.
>
> - GM sets a cost in `momentum` (0-2) for you to do a `flashback` scene.
> - Depending on the fiction, either
>   - the player gets what they want.
>   - the GM makes a fortune roll to see what happens.
>   - the player makes an action roll to see what happens.

# Momentum | Mechanics

We've talked about the fact that characters have a `momentum` track, which starts with `2` charges at the beginning of every session.

We've also seen that momentum can be consumed to **boost** action rolls, **assist** allies, and do **flashback** scenes.

Now we will go over the different methods to gain momentum during scenes.

Basically, you can either gain momentum as a **result of an action roll**, or by **adding tension** to the scene.

## Momentum from an Action

Everytime you make an action roll, you have a chance of gaining new charges of `momentum`.

The reason why each character starts with only `2 momentum` at the beginning of a session is because we want players who are running low to engage with the game mechanics instead of sitting back because they are out of resources.

**The main way you get momentum back is by participating in the game.**

**By default**, you gain momentum as a result of a successful action roll.

- If you rolled a `4-5`, you gain `+1 momentum`.
- If you rolled a `6`, you gain `+2 momentum`.
- If you rolled a `66`, you gain `+3 momentum`.

**Also, when momentum is spent for a roll, that roll cannot in turn generate momentum.**

While this is the default dial, we encourage you and your group to change this as you wish. Making momentum harder or easier to gain will have a big impact on the way the game plays out.

### Momentum Dial

Changing **when** and **how much** momentum is gained is called a `momentum dial`. Your group could decide to use the default setting for this dial, as it is a good starting point, but they could also change it more to their liking.

If for example you want to emphasize the fact that life is hard and resources are scarce, then consider making momentum harder to gain. If on the other hand, you want to tell the story of characters who are _over-the-top_, but still find a way to finish every adventure with their hat still sitting on their head, then consider making momentum easier to gain.

## Recap

> - Every time you make an `action roll`, you have a chance to gain `momentum`.

# Recovery | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/152570ee1895591ed40e267ac4eb35c1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-planet-futuristic-earth-5312500/)

**_Now, breathe..._**

As the game plays out, the PCs will get more stressed out and their condition will worsen.

When a PC accumulates `stress`, their actions are limited because of the narrative restrictions their `condition` creates.

Not every action will go well, and failing an action has consequences, which in turn will affect the characters for some time. The `stress clock` is used to track exactly this.

Things will eventually go back to normal, and the PCs will recover. But for the recovery to happen, it needs to happen in the **fiction first**.

## Recovering in the Fiction

When a player wants their character to recover stress, there needs to be **downtime** in the fiction.

If the group spends 3 sessions battling monsters in an epic dungeon, and tension is always through the roof, then the fiction doesn't allow for the recovery process to begin.

That being said, **downtime** doesn't mean that all the PCs have to sit down by a campfire and talk until they are all at _"full health"_.

In Charge, the structure of a session isn't enforced, so the PCs can do what ever they want, whenever they want. This is why there will be moments when it just doesn't make sense for the PC to recover at that time.

So **once** per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your `stress clock` to begin recovery. Also update the `condition` of your character to represent the character's current state after they started getting better.

We aren't using dice to support this mechanic because we don't believe luck should _generally_ factor in the healing process. Of course, there are moments where it could. If you want, you can use the [Fortune Roll](fortune-roll) mechanic to resolve this type of situation.

## Recap

> #### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your `stress clock` and update your `condition`.

# Fortune Roll| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/66adea5dff68c16c02527472648c8110.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/city-sunset-planet-mars-heaven-5312660/)

**_The future is in constant flux._**

Not everything is about the proficiencies of the PCs. There are situations where something is simply up to chance. In those situations, the GM can call for a `fortune roll`.

> **_You are looking in the wreckage of a ship; is anybody left alive? You find a pistol on the ground; are there still bullets in it? Two factions are at war; who will win the final battle?_**

To make a fortune roll, you need to assess the chances of a thing actually happening.

Is that thing likely or unlikely to happen? For each "likeliness" level, add `+1d6` to the dice pool.

- If there's a 50% chance of success, roll `1d6`. If it's more than that, add more dice to the pool.
- If it's really unlikely, roll `2d6` and pick the lowest result.

If two forces are opposing one another, roll two opposing pools and take the best result of each to interpret who "won" and by how much.

Once the pool(s) are ready, throw the dice and interpret the results.

> **_There's someone left alive on the ship, and they are still breathing. There are bullets in the gun, but the gun itself is broken and can't be used._**

Don't overthink this. This rule should not get in the way of the game. This mechanic is there to **quickly spice things up** during a scene when there's an unknown element that isn't controlled by the PCs.

```

```

## Recap

> - Add `+1d6` per likeliness level.

# Team Work | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/3cdd5a6bc018b408a461740f0f4451a1.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-moon-people-night-dream-6203763/)

**_It's dangerous to go alone, take this!_**

There are multiple ways player characters can help each other in Charge. They could **assist** each other, make a **setup action**, or even **protect** someone from danger.

## Assist

When you `assist`, you help another player who's making an action roll. Describe what your character does to help. When doing this, you also expose yourself to possible danger.

> **Consume `1 momentum`, and give them an additional `+1d6` for their roll.**
>
> ---
>
> _I can't reach it, can you give me a boost?_

## Protect

You step in to confront a consequence that one of your teammates would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene.

You can make a `determination roll` to try to reduce or cancel the consequence.

> **You suffer the consequence instead of them. You may call for a `determination roll` to reduce or cancel the consequence.**
>
> ---
>
> _Get behind my shield!_

## Set up

When you perform a setup action, you have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets `+1 effect` rating or an `improved position` for their roll.

You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

> **Make an action roll to improve the effect rating or position of a future action roll.**
>
> ---
>
> _First I'll distract them. Then you gotta make a run for it. OK?_

This is a good way to contribute to an operation when you don't have a good rating in the action at hand. A clever setup action lets you help the team indirectly - either in the moment or via a `flashback`. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup as long as it makes sense in the fiction.

### From Zero to Limited

Since a setup action can increase the effect of follow-up actions, it's also useful when the team is facing very tough opposition.

Even if the PCs are reduced to `zero effect` due to disadvantages in a situation, the setup action provides a bonus that allows for `limited effect`.

This gives them a fighting chance.

# Clocks| Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/635caaef063a8652b3ce86a0ad3eeb7a.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-clock-time-light-magic-3517206/)

A `clock` is a circle **divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments**. Draw a clock when you need to track an ongoing effort against an obstacle that cannot be resolved with a simple action roll.

Sneaking into a restricted area? Make a clock to track the alert level of the patrolling guards. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.

Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments the clock should have.

A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-segment clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.

Segments of clocks are ticked after an action roll. The **effect and position rating** help decide how many segments should get ticked as a result of the roll.

Clocks should always be about the obstacle that needs to be overcome, and not be about the "how". The action of the character already takes care of explaining the "how".

Here are a couple examples of how clocks could be used to represent some situation that might arise during scenes.

> ### Progress Clocks
>
> These represent the ongoing effort of someone to achieve their goal.
>
> When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can use a `progress clock` and:
>
> - Tick 1 segment for a `limited effect`.
> - Tick 2 segments for a `standard effect`.
> - Tick 3 segments for a `great effect`.
>
> ---
>
> _How much money do we need before we can fix the ship? How much damage can the city withstand before there's nothing left to save?_

> ### Danger Clocks
>
> These represent the imminent danger about to face the player.
>
> When a PC gets a consequence from an action roll, you can use `danger clock` and:
>
> - Tick 3 segments for a `desperate position`.
> - Tick 2 segments for a `risky position`.
> - Tick 1 segment for a `controlled position`.
>
> ---
>
> _How long until they realize we are here? How much oxygen do we have left?_

> ### Opposing Clocks
>
> These represent the progress of two opposing parties to get to their goal. The `effect` and `position` ratings can both be used to tick one or the other clock.
>
> ---
>
> _Can we win the race against the fan favourite? Can we convince the judge that we are wrongly accused before the end of the trial?_

## Recap

> #### Clocks

# Progression | Mechanics

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/8aeb209f8442ddf2ed9dab425bd9b603.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/cave-fantastic-light-nature-6481713/)

**_That's something I'll never forget._**


Even at the start of the story, characters in Charge are talented and proactive. 

After all, they are the protagonists of our story. If they fail at a task, it's _probably_ more because of unplanned circumstances than because of their lack of skills.

As time advances, the characters evolve and become more versatile, but this will only happen at certain `milestones`.

### Sessions

**At the end of each `session`**, each player can look at their character sheet and **update their character's `details`**.

You can use this opportunity to update their `ties`, `appearance` or even their `concept` if something important happened in the last session.

This is optional, but you can view this as an opportunity to update who your character is after each session and how they evolve over time.

```
TODO: Include Examples
```

### Milestone

A `milestone` happens **at the end of a big event** in the story. This will _usually_ happen every 3-5 sessions.

The GM will probably feel when it's time for a milestone, but as a player you can always remind the GM "_Hey, this looked like an important event in the story, would this be a milestone?_".

Just go with what feels right and adapt if necessary.

When the group reaches a milestone, every character gets a new `talent` on their character sheet.

A talent either gives the PC a new `action dot`, or a `situational talent`.

A situational talent gives a bonus or a certain narrative liberty during a certain situation.

- `+1d6 when ______`
- `+1 position when ______`
- `+1 effect when ______`
- `Use [action] instead of [action] when ______`
- `[New narrative liberty] when ______`

Gaining a new talent will feel like a breath of fresh air. It won't make your characters overpowered or god-like, but it will make them more flexible, or more specialized.

> #### Progression Curve
>
> Just as a reminder, the longer it takes for a milestone to happen, the longer it will take for characters to become stronger.
>
> This is important to keep in mind depending on what kind of progression curve you want to have.
>
> Do you want to have a short campaign where characters will grow stronger pretty quickly, or are you looking for a year-spanning campaign where the characters will mostly evolve by changing their character details and where milestones will be more scarce?
>
> You could go as low as giving the player character only 2-3 Talents during an entire campaign, or reward them more often.
>
> There isn't a right or wrong answer here. It depends 100% on what kind of campaign you want to have. This is also something you can discuss with the group to make sure everyone has the same expectations.

> #### Starting Talent
>
> Some groups already have a pretty good idea of who their character is and what they are good at.
>
> If that is the case with your group, it might be a good idea to offer them a starting talent in the form of `+1 Effect when ______`
>
> This will give them an edge in certain situation, without breaking the balance of the game.
>
> Here's an adapted [character sheet](/documents/fari-games/charge-rpg/downloads/character-sheet-with-starting-talent.pdf) to get you started.

### Situational Talents

Certain talents are situational. That is, they are only activated when you are in a **certain context** and using a **specific action**.

For example, when you get a `1 Effect when ____`, you will need to finish the end of that sentence by choosing one of the **12 Actions** and a certain **Situation** that will activate the talent.

Just look at what as already been established in the world, or your character's details, for inspiration.

To keep the flow of the game balanced, the GM will have a veto on what situation is good enough for your talent. Don't hesitate to experiment with this and fine-tune later if necessary.

The fact that writing up situational talents takes a bit of work is the reason why you don't get any talent dot by default at character creation.

We want character creation to be as streamlined as possible. Take the time to understand and discover who your character is first. 

Later in the campaign, when a milestone occurs, then you can think of new ways to make them truly unique using `talents`.

>_Yann's character is a monster hunter. Consequently, he's pretty good at **Studying** and **Muscle** in general. Yann also just got a new **talent dot** and would like to excel at tracking monsters specifically. Because monsters aren't encountered that frequently in the game, he asks the GM if his talent could be "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters**". The GM agrees. Now, Yann's character should be feared by most creatures roaming the lands._
>
>_In another session, the GM realizes that Yann's talent is perhaps too generic, and could be tuned a little. He then asks if it could be rewritten as something like "**+1 Position when I'm Shooting monsters in the forest**" or something along those lines. Yann agrees, saying "My character lived in the forest all their life, and would probably be intimidated by big cities. I like it; let's go with this for now!"_

# Projects and Complications | Mechanics

The Charge character sheet has a `Projects & Complications` section which contains a set of empty `clocks`.

Those clocks represent long-term projects or ever-evolving danger that the character will work on or experience across multiple sessions.

## Long-term Projects

Perhaps your character is piling up money to be able to afford something good for their family, or perhaps they are trying to figure out a way to reverse the damaged caused by a dangerous new disease that's plaguing the city.

In any case, once per session, if the narrative allows it, a character can make an action roll to work on those long-term agendas. The player works with the GM to describe what action they are taking to advance their agenda and figure out the `effect` and `position` of the roll.

 These projects are tracked using `progress clocks` on the character sheet. The `effect` rating of the roll determines how much the project progresses when the character is working on it.

Upon the completion of a project, the PC gets what they were working for. The resolution of said project creates a new narrative thread explained by the GM. This thread is something the group can decide to pursue or not.

## Complication

Perhaps the police department is starting to realize there are missing pieces in the evidence locker, or perhaps you are starting to attract more and more heat on you and your crew after your last couple jobs.

When a `complication` occurs as a result of a `consequence` of an action roll, the GM can tell the player to start or tick a `danger clock` on their character sheet.

Those complications aren't bound to the scene. Instead, they are tied to the character or the group as a whole.

Upon the completion of a complication's danger clock, the GM reveals a new dangerous situation to the group to represent what comes as a result of their actions.

Depending on the context, this new complication could be **imposed or exposed** to the group. 

- **When it is imposed**, the characters need to resolve it as soon as possible. The story cannot continue without this being taken care of first. 
- **When it is exposed**, the GM can foretell that the life of the group will be a bit more complicated because of a certain situation that comes from a result of that complication.

The goal here is to add emphasize that every action elicits a reaction from the world, even if it isn't immediate.

# In a Nutshell | Mechanics

## Character Creation

> ### Details
>
> Define who your character is.
>
> - `Concept`: The elevator pitch of your character.
> - `Appearance`: What your character looks like.
> - `Ties`: Connection with the other player's character or forces within the world.
>
> ### Actions
>
> Distribute `7 action dots` among the `12 actions` to define how good your character is at doing things.
>
> At character creation, a single `action` cannot have more than `2 action dots`.
>
> #### Physique
>
> - When you `Muscle`, you use your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
> - When you `Finesse`, you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
> - When you `Move`, you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
> - When you `Sneak`, you traverse skillfully and quietly.
>
> #### Insight
>
> - When you `Shoot`, you carefully track and shoot at a target.
> - When you `Tinker`, you understand, create, or repair complex mechanisms or organisms.
> - When you `Study`, you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
> - When you `Notice`, you observe the situation and anticipate outcomes.
>
> #### Resolve
>
> - When you `Bond`, you reassure and socialize with friends and contacts.
> - When you `Command`, you compel swift obedience with skills, respect or intimidation.
> - When you `Focus`, you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
> - When you `Sway`, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.
>
> ### Momentum
>
> - Every time you make an `action roll`, you have a chance to gain `momentum`.
> - You start every session with `2 momentum`.
>
>
> **When momentum is spent for a roll, that roll cannot in turn generate momentum.**
>
>
> #### Default Momentum Dial
>
> - Gain `+1 momentum` for a `4-5`.
> - Gain `+2 momentum` for a `6`.
> - Gain `+3 momentum` for a `66`.
>
> #### Using Momentum
>
> | Cost         | Result                                              |
> | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
> | `2 momentum` | `Push yourself` and add `+1d6` to your action roll. |
> | `1 momentum` | `Assist` an ally, add `+1d6` to their action roll.  |
> | `0-2 momentum` | Do a `flashback` scene.                             |
>

>
> ### Stress
>
> On a failed action roll, GM can inflict `stress` on a PC.
>
> The number of stress inflicted depends on the action's `position`:
>
> - `Controlled`: `+1 stress`
> - `Risky`: `+2 stress`
> - `Desperate`: `+3 stress`
>
> Each stress ticks a segment on a PC's stress clock. When you mark stress, you also need to add/update your `condition`.
>
> When the clock is filled, your character is taken out for the scene and your stress clock is cleared.

> ### Projects and Complications
>
> Use these `clocks` when a player has a long-term project or when the GM inflicts a complication as a `consequence`.

## Doing Things

> ### Action Roll
>
> Use this when someone, or something, is in your way.
>
> 1. Pick an `action` and find how many dice you need to roll.
> 1. Determine the `position` (`1 controlled` ► `2 risky` ► `3 desperate`)
> 1. Determine the `effect rating` (`3 great` ► `2 standard` ► `1 limited`)
> 1. Choose one:
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `push yourself` (`2 momentum`)
>    - Add `+1d6` if you `add tension` to the action.
> 1. Add `+1d6` if you have `assistance` (they consume `1 momentum`)
> 1. Roll and wish for the best!
>
>
> *If you don't have any action dots and can't `push yourself`, `add tension`, or `request assistance`, roll `2d6` and take the lowest result.*
>
>
> | Result | Name               | Explanation                                                       |
> | ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `66`   | `Critical Success` | You greatly overcome the obstacle.                                |
> | `6`    | `Full Success`     | You overcome the obstacle.                                        |
> | `4-5`  | `Partial Success`  | You overcome the obstacle, but there's a `consequence`.           |
> | `1-3`  | `Bad outcome`      | You fail at overcoming the obstacle, and there's a `consequence`. |
>
> ### Determination Roll
>
> Use this to resist a consequence, or incoming `stress`.
>
> - Roll `+1d6` per consumed charges of momentum.
>   - On a `1-3`, The `consequence` still happens.
>   - On a `4-5`, The `consequence` is reduced.
>   - On a `6`, The `consequence` is avoided.
>   - On a `66`, The `consequence` is avoided, and you get +1 `position` for your next roll.
>
> ### Recovery
>
> Use this to heal and recuperate.
>
> - Once per session, if the fiction allows it, clear 1 segment from your stress clock.

## Team Work

> ### Assist
>
> Use this to help a fellow PC accomplish their action.
>
> - Consume `1 momentum` and add `+1d6` to their roll.
> - This also exposes the helper to any potential consequences resulting from the roll.
>
> ### Protect
>
> Use this to protect a fellow PC from danger.
>
> - Roll to resist someone else's consequence.
>
> ### Set up
>
> Use this to improve your chances at overcoming an obstacle.
>
> - Roll to improve the `effect` rating or the `position` of subsequent action rolls made by your team.

## Misc

> ### Consequences

> Use this when there's a `bad outcome` on a PC's Action Roll.
>
> Select one of the following:
>
> - The `effect` of the roll is reduced.
> - A narrative `complication` occurs (you can track this on the character sheet).
> - The opportunity is lost and the PC must try a new approach.

# Asset Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra to make item discovery interesting

\- By René-Pier Deshaies

---

Assets are an extra that you can use as an alternative to `pushing yourself` or `adding tension` to a scene to get a bonus die when making an action roll.

## Loot Assets Rule

The Loot Asset is an additional mechanic that gives you the chance to find good loot that will have a mechanical impact on the game when you scavenge a place.

After a conflict between multiple parties is resolved, or when the general tension in a scene is reduced, you can do a `fortune roll` of `1d6` to find loot or to search a location.

- On a `6`, you create `1 asset`.
- On a `66`, you create `2 assets`.

Take note of this asset on your character sheet, and use it when the time is right to get a `+1d6` or `increased effect` on an action roll.

> #### Loot Roll
>
> - Roll **1d6**.
>   - On a 1-5: nothing happens.
>   - On a 6: you create one asset
>   - On a critical (66): you create two assets.
> - If an asset was created, take note of it on someone's character sheet.

### Boon Asset Rule

It's always amazing when a player loses themselves in their character, or has an amazing idea that is just too brilliant to ignore.

To make those moments shine even more, the GM can reward that player with an `asset`.

This is how the GM says: this was amazing, here's `+1d6` or `increased effect` for a future roll.

# Solo Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra to make unfair fights more awesome

\- By Valdy

---

Sometimes you want to play a game with only one Player Character, and other moments you are alone or your team was taken out.

This extra is for these moments.

## The Last Standing Rule

When you are alone, you are `the last standing`.

If this happens, `pushing yourself` will only cost `1 momentum per push`.

### Why to use this?

This is intended to those moments when, you are by yourself, you are the last hope, and then you find a new flame that allows you to overcome the impossible odds stacked against you.

### Design considerations

I have a tendency to make one to one games (one GM and one player), and Charge revolves around Momentum being gained and spent.

Almost all mechanics about spending Momentum relies on having someone else available to assist you. So, by reducing the cost of Pushing Yourself, you allow for a higher flow of Momentum, which is more fair since no one can Assist each other.

So, in short:

- If you are alone, you have fewer options to be awesome.
- So we reduce the cost of the remaining options.
- This allows Solo situations to be equally awesome.

# Attachment Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra to bring more focus on certain character details.

\- By René-Pier Deshaies, Nugat & Keita Creation

---

The Attachment Extra is an extra that you can use to make certain aspects of your characters more important to the game.

## Attachment Extra Rule

Characters are defined using `details` to represent who they are, what they are like and who they are linked to. By default, details don't have any mechanical uses in the game apart from providing narrative liberties.

If you want some of those details to feel more important in your game, you can consider them as `attachments`.

An `attachment` could be an important piece of equipment (a sword, a shield, a staff, a book, an armor), a relationship (an ally, a tie), or even a familiar.

An `attachment` is a character `detail` that you can choose to temporarily lose to resist an incoming `consequence`.

Doing this is called "breaking" the `attachment` and cancels the `consequence` outright. That means that the player does not have to make a `determination roll`.

However, this can only be done when it makes sense narratively, and that particular `attachment` cannot be used until time is taken to repair or reacquire it.

Since they can be used to cancel consequences entirely, characters only have between `1-2 attachments` each.

> #### Example
>
> _Jean-Loup's character is surrounded by a horde of monsters while inside his Mech. He just failed a `desperate` action rolls which will tick 3 segments of his character's stress clock._
>
> _To avoid this, Jean-Loup proposes to break his attachment **Mech's Core Reactor** to trigger an explosion, kill some monsters and give his character an opportunity to escape._
>
> _The GM agrees and ask Jean-Loup to start a new project progress clock if he wants to require a new core in the future_.

## Recovering an Attachment

Like character `details`, attachments provide narrative permissions to characters. When they are broken, those narrative permissions are lost.

To re-require or repair an attachment, the PC needs to start a `project progress clock` and track it on their character sheet.

The clocks starts at 4 segments, but may have more segments if the attachment is complicated to repair, if it was heavily damaged, or if it is difficult to reacquire.

To make progress on the project, a character may only roll to repair a "broken" attachment when they have the appropriate amount of downtime.

The amount of action rolls taken should be narratively related to the amount of downtime the character has. Pulling an all-nighter by a campfire may only be one roll, but if the character has a free week they may get three rolls or more.

Depending on what is being repaired, the player may have to make different `action rolls`, or may have multiple progress clocks at once. Repairing an armor may just require a `Tinker` action roll and some time at the forge, but contacting a demon and convincing them to work with you again may require first to `Focus` on a ritual, then try to `Bond` with them. The amount of segments ticked is usually tied to the `effect` rating of the `action roll`.

Once the project is completed, the character is permitted to use the attachment in the fiction, and is allowed to block a new consequence by breaking it once again.

## Attachment Condition

Maybe you want an attachment that degrades over time, with use or by soaking up consequences. You can do so by introducing the `Condition` mechanic from the character sheet on your attachment.

Then, the more damage your attachment takes (or the more you use it), the more this clock fills, and the attachment's condition changes.

Once the clock is full, the item is either irredeemably lost or unusable until it is partially or fully repaired (Which can happen during downtime or through action rolls).

If using the aforementioned repairing mechanic, you can have the repair clock be used as the item's stress clock, with each succesful repair clearing one (or multiple, your choice) segments.

## Credits

- Parts of this Extra were originally part of a work by **Keita Creations** which you can find on his [itch.io page](https://keitacreates.itch.io/repairs-and-restorations). Reprinted with permission.
- Thanks **Nugat** for the addition of Attachment Conditions
- Thanks **Lynn Jones** for finding the name `attachment` which is way better than the previous name this extra had.

> ## Recap
>
> - Each character has 1-2 `attachments`
> - `Attachments` are like character details. They give narrative liberties to the PCs.
> - If a PC wants, they can choose to **break their attachment** to outright cancel an incoming consequence. Doing so renders the attachment unusable in the narrative.
> - A PC can repair/require their attachment by creating a 4 segment `project progress clock` that they can work on in their downtime.

# World Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra to make the world feel more alive

\- By René-Pier Deshaies

---

The World Extra is a additional mechanic that is mostly useful if you want to make a custom Powered by Charge game that feels unique.

This extra also requires the GM to use a standard deck of playing cards.

## World Extra Rule

During sessions, the PCs will go on missions to accomplish objectives. They will then come back to their H.Q. to debrief, rest and recover.

At the start of a campaign, or **every time the PCs come back to their H.Q.**, the GM draws **3 `hook cards`** of a standard deck of playing cards.

- The first card tells us about something related to [Theme #1].
- The second card tells us about something related to [Theme #2].
- The third tells the GM what the PC's next mission is going to be.

The GM can use those hooks to create narrative threads for the PCs to explore and bring life to the world.

> #### Designer Note
>
> Change the themes to match your game's settings.
>
> - A game about a the crew of a space ship trying to make ends meet could have: **The Ship** / **The Crew** / **The Next Job**.
> - A game about a thieving crew could have: **The Crew** / **The Other Factions** / **The Next Score**.
> - A game about super heroes fighting crime in a metropolis could have: **The City** / **The News** / **The Next Crime**

</details>

Once the 3 cards are drawn, the GM uses the prompts on the first two to explain what happened while the PCs were away. The PCs can then spend time exploring those threads as they see fit.

When the PCs are ready for their next mission, the GM makes a `mission roll`.

To do so, the GM looks at the 3 cards they've drawn, and builds a dice pool of `1d6` for each red card (<span style="color:red">♥ ♦</span>).

If there's no red card, roll `2d6`, and select the lowest number.

The result of this roll tells us what is going to be the initial `position` the PCs will find themselves in when starting their next mission.

- On a `1-3`, the PCs start in a `desperate` position.
- On a `4-5`, the PCs start in a `risky` position.
- On a `6`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position.
- On a `66`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position, and gain some additional benefit.

The GM introduces the mission to the PCs, and they decide how they will approach the situation.

Once they've decided on a strategy, the GM cuts to the first scene of the mission using the result of the mission roll to describe the PCs current position.

Once the mission is over, the PCs go back to their H.Q., and the loop starts anew.

> #### Example
>
> _The PCs just got back to their space ship after pulling a very successful heist. As they come back, the GM draws 3 cards from a deck of cards._
>
> _The GM then reads the 3 prompts associated with the cards_
>
> - _**The AI**: The AI of the ship just discovered sarcasm. (`Red Card`)_
> - _**The Ship**: There are no more food-tubes in the kitchen. (`Black Card`)_
> - _**The Next Score**: A bounty was just put on a group of crazy pirates near the asteroid belt. (`Red Card`)_
>
> _The GM then gradually reveals those narrative hooks to the players as they interact with their ship._
>
> _When the PCs are ready to start their next mission, the GM rolls `2d6` (one for each red card). They get a `4`, so the mission will start with a `risky` position._
>
> _The GM then thinks about a way to make the bounty on the pirates more complicated. They decide that when the PCs arrive, there will already be another crew of scoundrels there trying to catch the bounty as well._

> ## Recap
>
> When the PCs go back to their HQ, the GM draws 3 card from a standard deck of playing cards.
>
> Each card gives a new story prompt to the GM to make the world feel more alive.
>
> To determine how the PC's next mission is going to start, roll `1d6` for each red card that was drawn. The result of this roll tells us what is going to be the initial `position` the PCs will find themselves in when starting their next mission.
>
> - On a `1-3`, the PCs start in a `desperate` position.
> - On a `4-5`, the PCs start in a `risky` position.
> - On a `6`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position.
> - On a `66`, the PCs start in a `controlled` position, and gain some additional benefit.

# Quick Charge Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra that simplifies the game for a reduced "time to table"

\- By René-Pier Deshaies

---

Quick Charge is an extra that simplifies the core rules of Charge so that it's easier to pick-up and play.

Use it for a quick one-shot, to introduce the Charge to new players, or simply because you prefer those streamlined rules.

Some text was copied over from the rest of the game to make this Extra stand on its own, but here's a quick rundown of the modifications for the Charge veterans reading this:

- There's only 2 character details: the `concept` and the `appearance`.
- The action list was reduced to 6 actions. Start with 4 action dots at character creation:
  - `Muscle`: you your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
  - `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
  - `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
  - `Study`: you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
  - `Talk`: you reassure, socialize or influence with kindness, guile, charm or argument.
  - `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.
- The `effect` rating is determined by the action roll's result:
  - A `66` gives a `+3 effect`.
  - A `6` gives a `+2 effect`.
  - A `4-5` gives a `+1 effect`.
- The consequence rating is determined by the action roll's result:
  - A `1-3` creates a `+2 consequence`
  - A `4-5` creates a `+1 consequence`
- Progress clocks are filled using the `effect rating` of an action roll.
- Danger clocks are filled using the `consequence rating` of an action roll.
- The stress clock is also filled using the `consequence rating` of an action roll.

## Quick Charge

### Character Creation

Characters are defined by descriptive traits called `details`. These highlight who they are, and what is important about them. Those details aren’t just information to give the character color, but should be the aspects of the character that we pay attention to in the story. They are also used as a guide to know the different narrative liberties that a character has in the fiction.

When creating a new character, write down their:

- `Concept`: an elevator-pitch version of who the character is.
- `Appearance`: what the character looks like, what they wear, etc.

#### Actions

When a PC needs to overcome an obstacle and there is a risk, they use one of their `actions`.

At character creation, players assign `4 action dots` among the following action list:

Assign `4 action dots` in:

- `Muscle`: you your force to move, overcome or wreck the obstacle in front of you.
- `Finesse`: you employ dexterous manipulation or subtle misdirection.
- `Move`: you quickly shift to a new position or get out of danger.
- `Think`: you scrutinize details and interpret evidence.
- `Talk`: you reassure, socialize or influence with kindness, guile, charm or argument.
- `Focus`: you concentrate to accomplish a task that requires great strength of mind.

#### Condition

A character's condition is tracked using a clock divided in 4 segments called the `stress clock ⨁`.

When they get hurt, that clock gets filled.

When the 4 segments of the `stress clock` are filled, the PC is taken out for the scene, and their stress clock is cleared. Because they were taken out, the next scenes should handle how the character's recovery is going to happen in the fiction.

### Rolling Dice

The game uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once, which we call a dice pool, and read the **single highest result**.

- If the highest die is a `6`, it's a `full success`. Things go well. If you roll more than one `6`, it's a `critical success` and you gain some additional advantage.
- If the highest die is a `4 or 5`, that's a `partial success`. You do what you were trying to do, but there is a consequence.
- If the highest die is `1-3`, it's a `bad outcome`. Things go poorly. You don't achieve your goal, and suffer a consequence.

_If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a critical when you have zero dice._

Most of the game's mechanics revolve around this basic format.

### Action Rolls

When there's a challenge that needs to be overcome, and there's a risk of failure, a player makes an `action roll`.

The number of dice to roll depends on the `action` the character is doing.

The action roll acts as double duty. Which means that it resolves what the PC is doing, as well as the NPC.

Here's what happens when a player makes an action roll:

#### 1. Player Sets Their Goal

The player states their goal and, which `action` they are using.

#### 2. The GM explains the risk

You would not be rolling if there were no risks. So the GM should explain to the player what they are getting themselves into.

#### 3. Player Evens the Odds

The player decides if they want to even the odds.

They can either

- `Push themselves`: Consume `2 momentum` to get `+1d6` or an improved effect rating.
- `Add tension` to the scene, to get `+1d6`.

They can also receive assistance from another PC for an additional `1d6`.

#### 4. Roll the Dice

Finally, the player rolls the dice, and the group judges the result.

- On a `66` it's a critical success. You _greatly_ achieve your goal with a `+3 effect`
- On a `6` it's a full success. You achieve your goal with a `+2 effect`
- On a `4-5` it's a partial success. You achieve your goal with a `+1 effect`, but there's a `+1 consequence`.
- On a `1-3` it's a bad outcome. Things go badly, and there's a `+1 consequence`.

If the result of the dice is higher than `3`, the PC gains `momentum` from their action except if they pushed themselves.

### Momentum

When a player makes an action roll, that roll has a chance generating `momentum`.

You start every session with `2`, and generate more `momentum` when making successful action rolls.

- On a `4-5`, you gain `+1 momentum`.
- On a `6`, you gain `+2 momentum`.
- On a `66`, you gain `+3 momentum`.

PCs consume their `momentum` to boost their actions, assist an ally or resist a `consequence`.

**When momentum is spent for a roll, that roll cannot in turn generate momentum.**

### Boosting Action Rolls

If you want, you can add bonus dice to your action roll by using **one** of the following methods.

#### Push Yourself

When you `push yourself`, you consume `2 momentum` per push to gain one of the following bonuses.

- Add `+1d6` to your dice pool.
- Gain `+1 effect rating` for your roll.
- Take action even if you were taken out.

#### Add Tension

When you `add tension` to an action roll, you can ask the GM _"What would adding tension would look like here?"_. The GM then offers a `consequence`, like ticking segments on a danger clock, inflicting stress on your character, or adding more drama to the narrative.

If you accept the `consequence`, add `+1d6` to your current dice pool.

### Team work

The PCs can help one another in different ways to assure that the teams overcome the different challenges that are facing them.

#### Assist

When you `assist` a PC, you consume `1 momentum`, to give `+1d6` to their roll. When doing this, you also expose yourself to possible danger.

#### Protect

When you protect a PC, you step in to confront a consequence they would otherwise face. Describe how you intervene, and suffer the consequence for them.

You can make a `determination roll` to try to reduce or cancel the consequence.

#### Set up

When you perform a setup action, you make an `action roll` to have an indirect effect on an obstacle. If your action has its intended result, any member of the team who follows through on your maneuver gets `+1 effect` level for their roll.

You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

### Determination Roll

If a character suffers a `consequence` that you, as a player, don't like, you can try to resist it.

You do so by calling for a `determination roll` to see how well you resist the consequence.

Build a pool of d6s by adding `+1d6` for each charge of momentum you are willing to consume for the roll.

Once you've decided how many charges you want to consume, roll and interpret the results:

- On a `1-3`, the `consequence` still happens.
- On a `4-5`, the `consequence` is reduced.
- On a `6`, the `consequence` is avoided.
- On a `66`, the `consequence` is avoided, and you get some other benefit.

### Clocks

Clocks are circles divided in either 4, 6 or 8 segments.

Use those to track a task's **progress** or escalating **danger** in scenes.

- When a PC succeeds an action roll, you can tick 1 segment of a `progress clock` for each `effect` rating.
- When a PC suffers a `consequence` from an action roll, you can tick 1 segment of a `danger clock` for each `consequence` rating.

When a clock is filled, a narrative element in the story is now resolved. Either the PCs got closer to their goal, or danger has come to fruition and makes the situation more complicated.

### Recovery

As time passes, PCs will get better, and their condition will improve.

If the fiction allows it, once per session clear 1 segment off a PC's `stress clock`.

### Fortune Rolls

When the outcome of a situation isn't certain, and the players aren't involved, the GM makes a `fortune roll` to see what happens.

Add `+1d6` per likeliness level of that thing happening.

- On a **critical success**, great results, and something exceptional happens.
- On a **full success**, great results.
- On a **partial success**, mixed results.
- On a **bad outcome**, bad results.

### Flashbacks

Players can call for a `flashback` scene if they want to declare that their character tried to prepare for a certain situation before it happened.

Flashback scenes aren't like time travel, and can't undo what was already established in the narrative.

When a player calls for a flashback scene:

- The GM sets a cost in `momentum` between `0-2` for the scene.
- Depending on the fiction, either
  - the player gets what they want.
  - the GM makes a fortune roll to see what happens.
  - the player makes an action roll to see what happens.

# Magic Extra | Extras

A Charge RPG Extra to guide you on how to introduce magic in your game

\- By Nugat

---

This extra is meant to emulate low-level magic, so it may not be the best to use in high-powered settings, or setting where magic is everywhere.

## The Magic Dial

First, you want to decide **which action to use**, though you are not restricted in how many you select in the same setting or for a single spell :

Is magic made of drawn-out rituals that require you to spend a long time gathering some amount of magic power ? Then you need `Focus`

Does magic require careful movements or even danses that you have to execute perfectly ? That would require some amount of `Finesse`

Is magic made of alchemy and enchanting ? This sounds like `Tinkering`

Is magic something made out of a runic language that you have to decipher, arias you need to know by heart or complex drawings ? I hope you're a good `Study` (but `Focus` could work, especially if you have a book in hand!)

Do you use Hypnosis or Kototama (japanese word magic)? It might be `Sway` or `Command`

Maybe you need to use your `Bond` with a specific god to call upon their particular powers.

Be creative with magic! Maybe one spell requires multiple actions, maybe one spell can be cast in multiple different ways.

> _For her specific game about mages with books and incantations, Alice has decided that magic can be done in two ways : Either the character can `Focus` on reading from the book, or they could simply remember a prior `Study` if the character doesn't have their book on hand. But, for a ritual to summon a being from another world, she has decided that the spell require a clock to be filled. Half of it must be filled with `Focus` as the character reads incantations from the book, but the other half has to be done with `Command`, as they must bind the being to their will._

## The Cost of Magic

Depending on the tone of your game, magic can have different costs and have different effects :

For a cost, magic could require any of :

- Some amount of `momentum`.
- Time (require a `clock` to be filled).
- Risk (put you in a certain `position` by default).
- Danger (a `clock` to tick on consequences that is in your character's `complications` on their sheet).
- Materials (no need to keep an inventory, use common sense).
- Casting Prerequisites (at night; on-site; with a spell tome).
- Casting Limits (once per day; once per session; once in the whole campaign).
- Drawbacks (create collateral damage; take stress).
- Long-term effects on the caster (maybe it takes a toll on their health, maybe it even corrupts them [if someone makes a corruption extra, add it here].).

Just be sure the effect that you're giving magic fits the cost, so that your players will always be tempted to use it.

> _For the summoning ritual from before, alice decides it should be a time-consuming process with a lot of care put into it. She decides that the spell is an eight-segment clock, and that each segment represents one hour of game time where the character has to conclude the ritual. Obviously, it's also going to require an entire empty room dedicated to the summon. If the character fails at any point, she could make the entire spell fail, but she decides on something else : for every consequence, she ticks a segment from a four-segment clock. When it is filled, the being is summoned, but they are hostile to the player who summoned them._

## The Effect(s) of Magic

### Magic with Multiple Uses and Magic Items

When creating a magic item, or when using magic that may be used multiple times in the same cast, you should likely define limits to the spell :

- Either use the [Attachment extra](https://fari.games/en/srds/fari-games/charge-rpg/attachment-extra) for a protective item.
- Use a "magic charge" clock that depletes with use (may or may not be replenished by the caster) that can be tracked on the character sheet, using `projects`.
- For both of the aforementioned items, you may use [Keita Creation's repairs and restoration rules](https://keitacreates.itch.io/repairs-and-restorations)
- Make the spell much harder to cast and more dangerous on further uses in the same scene.
- Make further uses of the effect have a cost (see above).
- For an item, allow the character wearing the item to roll for the spell in lieu of the caster (give them narrative permission to do something).
- You may treat the item as an [Asset](https://fari.games/en/srds/fari-games/charge-rpg/asset-extra) for spells with delayed effect
- You may also treat them as an [Asset](https://fari.games/en/srds/fari-games/charge-rpg/asset-extra) for spells multiple uses using a clock, either with fixed effect, or with different effects depending on the number of segments ticked (see below)

### The effect of magic

Use the effect rating of the spell, or empty segments (if the spell is a clock), to determine its effect. When ticking clocks, follow the normal rules. If the spell is meant to help an ally or hinder the enemy, it applies a bonus (only on rolls where the effect might be relevant) :

A spell with **limited** effect (1 segment) will only have a small impact on whatever you're doing : it only provides a better effect or a better position

A spell with **normal** effect (2 segments) is stronger : it gives you an extra d6 when rolling

A spell with **great** effect (3 segments) is powerful : it gives you both better effect or position and gives you an extra d6 when rolling.

Critical successes on spells raise the effect by one level for every additionnal d6 besides the first. A critical success on a spell that already had a **great** effect can have two effect : either it provides better effect, position and an extra d6, or it simply lets the character automatically succeed on a roll where the effect applies (in that case, the effect rating stays the same).

> _The being has been summoned succesfully, and it is now represented by a post-it that has a name and a clock. She decides that the spirit is a **normal** spiritual being that may be commanded any time the summoner wants to provide an extra d6 when rolling a dice when it would make sense that the spirit could act on behalf of the character. Since it acts instead of the character, Alice decides that the being has its own stress clock to tick on consequences._
>
> _But, since this is a powerful effect, it also has a powerful drawback : Using the spiritual being is taxing on both body and mind, and any uses of the being tick one segment of the character's condition clocck. Furthermore, as soon as the character is taken out, the being breaks free of the spell and turns hostile to the party._

# Making a Compelling Campaign | Preparing the Game

[![Image by KELLEPICS from pixabay.com](https://gyazo.com/7b529142ada0e29c88323c82eec6c3ab.png)](https://pixabay.com/photos/fantasy-landscape-mountains-rock-6328992/)

You've got a GM and players. You're relatively comfortable with the basic mechanics, and you are ready to play Charge.

Amazing!

Now comes the important question that will affect everyone for the weeks/months to come: **what should the story be about, and how should it be played out?**

In the next chapter, we will go over how to find a good setting to play in, how to organize the campaign, and how to play it out.

These are merely suggestions and can be taken with a pinch of salt.

Whether this is your first rodeo or not, we think those are good starting points to enjoy a good campaign in general.

This exercise should be done as a group, though some steps could be done solely by the GM, depending on what kind of game you want to have.

So first, you need to pick a setting.

## Finding a Setting

Charge is a generic game, so it doesn't come with a default world for you to play in. That means that we leave you the pleasure of talking with the rest of your group to find a setting that makes everyone at the table excited.

A good way to start the conversation is by asking the group to talk about their favourite media, e.g. books, video games, movies, TV shows, etc. If they can't think of anything, ask them what they watched/read/played recently.

For every media that is brought up, try to discuss what made it interesting. Was it the setting, the characters, the magic, the politics?

From there, take a piece of paper and list everything that is discussed. You might start to see a trend, like a specific genre that seems to interest most of the group.

Once people at the table run out of ideas, you can go over the list of all the suggestions and see if everyone can align on a specific existing setting.

## Establish the World

When the group is aligned on which setting they want to play in, it is important to do a quick refresher on the facts of this setting.

This is how we **establish the world**.

To do so, look at what makes this world unique and fire off questions around the table to make sure everyone is aligned on the answers.

If there's magic in the world: who can do it? what do you need to do it? what are the limitations? ...etc.
If you are in space: which galaxy are you in? are most planets terraformed? ...etc.

Not everything needs to be factualized. Otherwise, you would end up talking about lots of finicky little details for hours. This isn't the goal.

What isn't covered here will be covered later during a game session. The goal is mostly to get a general understanding of what is accessible and possible.

This exercise could prove to be a little bit more work if the group decided to make a brand new setting that isn't directly taken from existing media, but it can be very rewarding nonetheless.

## Add Trouble to the World

So, we now have all the main ingredients to make a great campaign, but we are missing one crucial thing: the spices.

We need to add some trouble in our world so that the campaign evolves interestingly overtime. Whether the player characters interact with those events is another subject, but what we want to do is make the world feel real.

This can be done as a group, but could also be done by the GM alone.

It really depends on what type of game you want to play. Do you want everything about the story to be transparent to everyone, or do you prefer that the GM think of these things on their side and keep some surprises for the group?

Your table, your call.

So, to make the world feel real, we define 1-3 `World Forces`.

> A `Force` is something or someone with goals looking to change the status quo in significant and narratively interesting ways.

We are using the term `Force` here instead of enemy, foe, or big bad, because a force isn't necessarily a person.

That's why you shouldn't always think of a force as something that will go toe-to-toe against the PCs.

It is entirely up to the PCs how they want to interact with the `World Forces`. The group could be opposed to some, allied with others, and neutral about the rest.

> A `Force` could be a Person, but it could also be an Organization, a Country, a Planet, Mother Nature, or the Space-Time Continuum!

Once you have found one or two interesting `World Forces`, you need to think about their `Goal`.

Their goal defines the impact the force will have on the world. A `goal` isn't necessarily good or bad— it is merely what the force wants to accomplish. It can also be considered as "good" by the `Force` itself, but others might have different view on the subject.

> A `Goal` could be to take back the throne, protect the galaxy from thieves and thugs, or to open a portal that connects to another world.

Now that we have a `Force,` and that force has a `Goal`, let's find out how they interact with the world to achieve said goal. We do this by defining their `Methods`.

A Force's Methods represents what they do to get closer to their goal. Each Force has around `2-3 Methods`.

> `Methods` could be things like trying to recruit people in an army, trying to corrupt government officials, or increasing the military surveillance over a certain artifact.

You can repeat this exercise as many times as you want depending on how many starting forces you want to have in your world.

Each `Force` will then live inside your world, and as the players interact with the world, the forces do too.

As time advances, they will act with their `Methods`, which will get them closer or further away from their `Goals`.

> #### Force Example
>
> **The Rebel Forces** want to **get rid of the usurper that sits on the throne by:**
>
> - _Finding dirt on the government to expose corruption._
> - _Convincing the real king to take back what is theirs._
> - _Finding money to hire mercenaries to fight an eventual war._

## Define the Group as a Force

Now that we've added more life into our world, we can determine what the group is all about.

Doing this is pretty straightforward. Simply do the exact same exercise we did above, but now the `Force` we are creating represents the group of player characters.

To define the group as a `Force`, all the players need to align on what they are about. To do this, they should look back at the `World Forces` and decide how they feel about them. Are they aligned, neutral, or against the different Goals of those Forces?

That's why we defined the `World Forces` before the `Player Force`.

Once the players have a general idea of what their group is about, write a `Force`, a `Goal`, and 2-3 `Methods` that represent them.

# What to Hack | Hacking the Game

You've read the rules and best practices, and your first thought is:

**_This is great! Now, how can I hack this ?_**

Great!

Charge comes with a default set of rules, but most of them can be altered to **help you make each game your own**.

This chapter provides some guidelines about what is hackable by design. It also provides some ideas on how to design new mechanics around what is already in place to keep the "Charge feeling".

## Hacking Character Details

The character's details section is possibly the easiest section to change since it doesn't impact the mechanic, or the balance of the game.

By default, a character is defined by short descriptors called `details`.

They have a `concept` to explain who they are, an `appearance` to know what they look like, and `ties` to link them to the world.

### Changing the Details

To make your own details, think of what is important in your setting.

If your setting heavily focuses on which god the PCs worship, than add a `God` detail. If characters have a specific role in the group, add a detail for this as well.

While those descriptors aren't _really_ used by the game mechanics, they are still relevant in highlighting **what is important in your game**.

## Hacking the Actions

Another great way of to adapting Charge is by changing the standard `12 actions`.

### Changing the Words

Words are important. When carefully chosen, they help convey a meaning.

Charge comes with a default set of generic actions. Because they are generic, they might not necessarily fit with the setting you've chosen.

If some of those words feel off, rename them.

Replace `Tinker` by `Craft` or `Hack`. Or replace `Sway` by `Negotiate` or `Argue`.

Even a small change in wording can affect the underlying tone of what the action does.

Use this to evoke a genre, and highlight the risky actions that the PCs will be doing.

### Changing the Number of Actions

If you feel like 12 actions to memorize is too much, you can reduce the list to 9 or even 6 actions.

Reducing the number of actions also means that each action will cover more use. Take that into consideration when choosing your action words.

Also think about the **maximum action rating** (default is 4) and the **number of action dots** (default is 7) each character gets at the beginning of a game.

## Hacking Momentum

Momentum is pretty much hackable by default because of the existence of the `momentum dial`.

When you start a new campaign, check if the default `momentum dial` feels good for you and your group.

Do you have a feeling that PCs gain momentum too often ? Or do you think that when it is gained, the amount gained should be more generous ? There is no golden hammer here, every story is different.

To make your own `momentum dial`, simply look at **when** momentum is generated. Then look at **how much** momentum is gained when it's generated.

Tweak those two variables until things feel right.

## Hacking Talents

Talents exists to make character progression interesting. The talent tree makes character a bit stronger, but mostly it makes them more versatile.

### Changing the Tree

A way you can hack talent is by changing the content of the talent tree. By default, a talent either gives you a **new action dot**, or a **situational bonus**.

You could change the content of that tree to make certain types of talent more common than others. You could also create brand new types of talent that would make players more invested in your game.

### Changing When Talent Dots are Gained

Talent dots are usually gained after narrative `milestones`. Depending on the genre, you could alter this and make talent dots gained in different scenarios.

A player could gain a talent dot when they fail a `desperate` roll, or when they finish a `project` clock on their character sheet.

Talents are a great player incentive, so hacking this is an easy way to reinforce behaviors you want your players to do.

### Changing the Cost of Activating a Talent

You can also change the cost of using a talent. By default, talents are free to invoke, but it doesn't have to be.

An easy cost to set for activating a talent would be using momentum.

If you set a cost of `1 momentum`, talents could be seen as a way to get bonuses at a cheaper cost than `pushing oneself`.

If you set a cost of `2 momentum` for a talent, then consider giving a bigger bonus than what a a usual `push` would give.

Just remember to keep things fair!

## Hacking Conditions

A PC's condition acts as a combat pacing mechanism, but also as a way to represent the character's current health condition.

### Changing The Stress Clock

If characters in your world are supposed to be weaker to tougher, change the number of segments in the stress clock.

This is an easy change that has a big impact on in-game challenges.

Be warned that having bigger stress clocks can make conflicts drag for longer. This can either be a good, or bad thing, depending on what you're going for.

### Changing Recovery

Another important detail about condition is that they are supposed to recover after a time.

By default, a stress clocks recovers **one segment per session**, if the fiction allows it.

You could offer other opportunities to PCs to get better. Perhaps by going to see a doctor, or by interacting with the "medic" of the group.

Doing this will affect what the PCs do immediately after big battles, because they usually don't like staying "hurt" for a long time.

> #### Luck Based Recovery
>
> Be wary of making recovery based on luck.
>
> If you use action or fortune rolls to recover, a couple of bad rolls in a row can make for quite a couple of uninteresting session for a player.
>
> That's something that we _usually_ want to try to avoid.

### Introducing Penalties

Apart from narrative limitations, conditions don't inflict penalties on characters. This is by design.

In Charge, we prefer to encourage good behaviors than to give punishment for simply having played the game. The game is about rewarding interactions, and pacing failures.

That doesn't mean that we want to discourage you from doing something different in your game.

We mostly want to highlight why Charge is the way it is so that you take it into consideration when designing new modifications to the rules.

### Introducing Deterioration

For some types of games, you might also want to consider if conditions can get worse if the PCs ignore them.

Things like poison or untreated wounds can make a character's life harder over time.

For this, you could think of ways of making stress clocks "auto-advance" based on certain triggers. Figure out what those triggers are and how many segments are ticked when they happen.

You should also think of opportunities for players to take care of those deteriorations so that they stop being inflicted upon their characters.

# Making Playbooks | Hacking the Game

<p style="font-size:3rem; text-align:center; margin:0;">👷‍♀️ 🚧 🚧 🚧 👷</p>

In Charge, we don't offer a list of playbooks, archetypes or classes for the players to choose from when starting a new game. This is because we want players to be able to create the character they want to, without limiting their creativity.

This doesn't mean that they shouldn't exists. Playbooks are an amazing solution to the blank page syndrome when creating a character.

With a bit of preparation, the game master can create a set of playbooks for their players to choose from. Designers who want to use Charge as the framework of their game can also use this method for their game.

## Playbook Recipe

Here's a recipe on how to create a playbook for Charge using the default character sheet as a basis for it.

### Details

Find a name for your playbook. Once you have a good catchy name, write it down as the character's `concept`.

Leave the `appearance` box empty for the player to fill. Also write down a list of possible `ties` for the player to choose from when they make their character.

### Actions

Each playbook should have 3 action dots pre-assigned on the default sheet. This helps the player understand what this class of character is good at by default.

This leaves 4 action dots that they can assign wherever they want to make their implementation of that playbook their own.

### Talents

Each playbook should feel a bit different to play from one another.

In the `talents` section, pre-fill the situational talents by things that make sense for that playbook.

### Rinse and Repeat

Once you've done one playbook, just repeat the process a couple of time to offer different archetypes to your players.

This should help your players find interesting ideas for their characters since constraints are known to aid with creativity.

# What Next

Now that you've read the game form start to finish, you might wonder that you need to do next.

You might feel comfortable enough to talk to a group of friends and look into starting your own game of Charge right away. If that's the case, great!

Perhaps you liked what you read, but you want to homebrew it to fit a certain style. If so, you can re-read chapter about [hacking the game](what-to-hack) to have some guideline about what you can hack and how. You can also re-read the section about [extras](what-are-extras) which contains community made hacks that you can use in your game! You can also submit your own extras on [Charge's Itch Community](https://itch.io/category/1543442/new-topic) to get feedback from the community.

If what you've read has inspired you to make your own **Powered by Charge** game, then check-out the [Charge System Reference Document](/en/srds/fari-games/charge-srd) as a good starting point.

To talk with people who have played or hacked the game before, join [Fari's Discord Server](https://fari.app/discord) for great discussions about anything Charge related!

Lastly, if you liked what you read, consider [donating](https://farigames.itch.io/charge-rpg) some money on itch.io.

All the funds are re-invested in the game to buy original art, paying editors or translators.

Thank you, and go power your storytelling!
